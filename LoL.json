                "lore_full": "<p>Whether mistaken for a demon or god, many tales have been told of the Darkin Blade... but few know his real name, or the story of his fall.</p><p>In ancient times, long before desert sands swallowed the empire, a mighty champion of Shurima was brought before the Sun Disc to become the avatar for a now forgotten celestial ideal. Remade as one of the Ascended, his wings were the golden light of dawn, and his armor sparkled like a constellation of hope from beyond the great veil.</p><p>Aatrox was his name. He was at the vanguard of every noble conflict. So true and just was his conduct that other god-warriors would always gather at his side, and ten thousand mortals of Shurima marched behind him. When Setaka, the Ascended warrior-queen, called for his help against the rebellion of Icathia, Aatrox answered without hesitation.</p><p>But no one predicted the extent of the horrors that the rebels would unleash\u2014the Void quickly overwhelmed its Icathian masters, and began the grinding annihilation of all life it encountered.</p><p>After many years of desperate battle, Aatrox and his brethren finally halted the Void\u2019s perverse advance, and seared the largest rifts shut. But the surviving Ascended, the self-described Sunborn, had been forever changed by what they had encountered. Though Shurima had triumphed, they all had lost something in their victory... even noble Aatrox.</p><p>And in time, Shurima fell, as all empires must.</p><p>Without any monarch to defend, or the existential threat of the Void to test them, Aatrox and the Sunborn began to clash with one another, and eventually this became a war for the ruins of their world. Mortals fleeing the conflict came to know them instead by a new and scornful name: the <i>darkin.</i></p><p>Fearing that these fallen Ascended were as dangerous to Runeterra\u2019s survival as the Void incursions had been, the Targonians intervened. It is said that the Aspect of Twilight gave mortals the knowledge to trap the darkin, and the newly reborn Aspect of War united many in fighting back against them. Never fearing any foe, Aatrox and his armies were ready, and he realized only too late that they had been deceived. A force greater than a thousand dead suns pulled him inside the sword he had carried into battle countless times, and forever bound his immortal essence to it.</p><p>The weapon was a prison, sealing his consciousness in suffocating, eternal darkness, robbing him even of the ability to die. For centuries, he strained against this hellish confinement... until some nameless mortal was foolish enough to try and wield the blade once more. Aatrox seized upon this opportunity, forcing his will and an imitation of his original form onto his bearer, though the process quickly drained all life from the new body.</p><p>In the years that followed, Aatrox groomed many more hosts\u2014men and women of exceptional vitality or fortitude. Though his grasp of such magics had been limited in life, he learned to take control of a mortal in the span of single breath, and in battle he discovered he could feast on his victims to build himself ever larger and stronger.</p><p>Aatrox traveled the land, searching desperately, endlessly, for a way return to his previous Ascended form\u2026 but the riddle of the blade proved unsolvable, and in time he realized he would never be free of it. The flesh he stole and crudely shaped began to feel like a mockery of his former glory\u2014a cage only slightly larger than the sword. Despair and loathing grew in his heart. The heavenly powers that Aatrox had once embodied had been wiped from the world, and all memory.</p><p>Raging against this injustice, he arrived at a solution that could only be born of a prisoner\u2019s desperation. If he could not destroy the blade or free himself, then he would embrace oblivion instead.</p><p>Now, Aatrox marches toward this merciless goal, bringing war and death wherever he goes. He clings to a blind hope: if he can drive all of creation into a final, apocalyptic battle\u2014where everything, <i>everything</i> else is destroyed\u2014then maybe he and the blade will also cease to exist.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>For most of her life, Ahri's origins were a mystery to her, the history of her vastayan tribe all but lost&nbsp;save for the twin gemstones she has carried her entire life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ahri's earliest memories are of running with icefoxes in the northern reaches of Shon-Xan. Though she knew she was not one of them, they clearly saw her as something of a kindred spirit, and came to accept her within the pack.</p>\n<p>In that wild, predatory existence, Ahri nonetheless felt a deeper connection to the forests around her. In time, she came to understand that this was the magic of the vastaya that coursed through every fiber of her being, and the realm of spirits that lay beyond. With no one to teach her, instead she learned to call upon this power in her own ways\u2014most often using it to quicken her reflexes in pursuit of prey. If she was careful and close enough, she also found she might soothe a panicked deer, so that it remained serene and calm even as she and her packmates sank their teeth into its flesh.</p>\n<p>The world of mortals was as distant and unsettling to Ahri as it was to the icefoxes, but she felt drawn to it for reasons she could not explain. Humans in particular were coarse, gruff creatures\u2026 and when a band of huntsmen camped nearby, Ahri watched them from afar as they went about their grim business.</p>\n<p>When one of them was wounded by a stray arrow, Ahri could feel his life seeping away. Knowing nothing but the instincts of a predator, she savored the spirit essence leaving his body, and through it gained brief flashes of his memories\u2014the lover he had lost in battle, and the children he had left behind when he came north. Ahri subtly pushed his emotions from fear to sorrow to joy, and comforted him with visions of a sun-soaked meadow as he died.</p>\n<p>Afterward, she found that human words now came to her easily, like something from a half-remembered dream, and Ahri knew the time had come to leave the pack behind.</p>\n<p>Keeping to the fringes of society, she felt more alive than ever. Her predatory nature remained, but she was caught up in a riot of new experiences, emotions, and customs across Ionia. Mortals, it seemed, also became fascinated by her in return\u2014and she often used this to her advantage, draining their essence while charming them with recollections of beauty, hallucinations of deep longing, and occasionally dreams colored by raw sorrow.</p>\n<p>She grew drunk on memories that were not her own, and exhilarated in ending the lives of others even as she felt the grief and woe she brought to her victims. She experienced heartbreak and elation in tantalizing flashes that left her craving more. It was overwhelming, but she sensed her own power fading whenever she tried to stay away, and could not help but partake again and again\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In time, she began to see herself as mortals did: a monster.</p>\n<p>Until one day, an artist stumbled upon her, hunched over a man as she drained his life essence from him. Where others would run, he stayed, offering his own life essence in exchange for her heart. For the first time in her life, Ahri let herself fall in love and be loved, wholly and completely.</p>\n<p>Their days passed in warmth and laughter, Ahri curbing her hunger by feeding on her lover. She was truly happy... until she lost control, draining her lover completely.</p>\n<p>Ahri fell into despair, her grief consuming her as she mourned the loss of the first and only person she's ever truly loved. The first and only person who ever truly loved her. Retreating even further from society, she became consumed with learning more about where she came from, in hopes that it would help her control her abilities.</p>\n\n<p>With her twin sunstones in hand, she set out in search of others like her, a journey that would take her out of Ionia and across Runeterra, eventually leading her to the discovery of her ancestors, the Vesani, a vastayan tribe that brought innovation and magic to the world before being wiped out.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by their memories, Ahri has set off to travel the world in search of other remnants of the Vesani. She hopes to carry their legacy forward, bringing good into the world like they did. No longer burdened by the heavy weight of her regrets, she also hopes to finally leave her stolen memories behind and create new memories of her own making.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>Innately connected to the magic of the spirit realm, Ahri is a fox-like vastaya who can manipulate her prey's emotions and consume their essence\u2014receiving flashes of their memory and insight from each soul she consumes.

Sometimes it needs to be kept in check.</p><p>The Kinkou are the self-appointed keepers of Ionia\u2019s sacred balance. The order\u2019s loyal acolytes walk the spirit and material realms, mediating conflicts between them and, when necessary, intervening by force. Born among their ranks was Akali, daughter of Mayym Jhomen Tethi, the renowned Fist of Shadow. Mayym and her partner Tahno raised their daughter within the Kinkou Order, under the watchful leadership of Great Master Kusho, the Eye of Twilight.</p><p>Whenever her parents were called away, other members of the order stepped in as Akali\u2019s surrogate family. Kennen, the Heart of the Tempest, spent many hours with the young girl, teaching her shuriken techniques, and emphasizing speed and agility over strength. Akali was a precocious child, and soaked up the knowledge like a sponge. It became clear to all that she would follow her parents\u2019 path\u2014along with the Great Master\u2019s son and appointed successor Shen, she would lead a new generation dedicated to preserving Ionia\u2019s balance.</p><p>But balance can be fleeting. The order found itself divided.</p><p>A wayward acolyte named Zed returned, and clashed violently with Kusho, wresting power in a bloody coup. Akali fled into the eastern mountains along with Mayym, Shen, Kennen, and a handful of other acolytes. Sadly, Tahno was not among them.</p><p>Zed\u2019s transformation of the Kinkou into the merciless Order of Shadow was almost complete. But, as the new Eye of Twilight, Shen intended to rebuild what had been lost. They would return to the Kinkou\u2019s three fundamental philosophies: the pure impartiality of <i>Watching the Stars</i>, the passage of judgment in <i>Coursing the Sun</i>, and the elimination of imbalance by <i>Pruning the Tree</i>. Even though they were now few, they would train neophytes to restore and grow their numbers once more.</p><p>When Akali came of age at fourteen, she formally entered her Kinkou training, determined to succeed her mother as the new Fist of Shadow.</p><p>She was a prodigious fighter, and mastered the kama and kunai\u2014a handheld sickle and throwing dagger. Though she did not possess the magical abilities of many of her fellow acolytes, she proved to all she was worthy of the title, in time allowing her mother to step down and help mentor the younger neophytes.</p><p>But Akali\u2019s soul was restless, and her eyes were open. Though the Kinkou and the Order of Shadow had come to an uneasy accord in the wake of the Noxian invasion of Ionia, she saw that her homeland continued to suffer. She questioned whether they were truly fulfilling their purpose. Pruning the Tree was meant to eliminate those who threatened the sacred balance... yet Shen would always urge restraint.</p><p>He was holding her back. All the mantras and meditations could quiet her spirit, but such platitudes would not defeat their adversaries. Her youthful precociousness turned to outright disobedience. She argued with Shen, she defied him, and she took down Ionia\u2019s enemies <i>her</i> way.</p><p>In front of the whole order, she declared the impotence of the Kinkou, all its talk of spiritual balance and patience accomplishing little. Ionians were dying in the material realm, and that was the realm Akali would defend. She was trained as an assassin. She was going to <i>be</i> an assassin. She did not need the order anymore.</p><p>Shen let her go without a fight, knowing this was a path that Akali must walk alone. Perhaps that path would bring her back one day, but that would be for her to decide.</p>",

His punishment is swift, certain, and exacted by a curious weapon that rights the wrongs of his foes.</p><p>Raised on the streets of the city of Marwi, Akshan was introduced to injustice at birth. In a place where local warlords took what they wanted, most people survived by keeping their heads down and minding their own affairs. Try as he might, young Akshan could never manage to let bad deeds go unnoticed and was often quick to intervene when he saw someone being mistreated. This approach made the boy many powerful enemies, and on one fateful occasion, left him beaten within an inch of his life.</p><p>But luck was on his side. An old woman named Shadya found the boy unconscious in the street outside her dwelling. Though Marwian custom said she should not get involved, she took young Akshan inside and, against all odds, he pulled through.</p><p>As Akshan regained his faculties, he realized his savior was no ordinary woman. Shadya was a member of the Sentinels of Light, an ancient order committed to fighting Harrowings and eradicating agents of the Black Mist. She saw Akshan as a troubled youth, stubborn and defiant, but vulnerable. After butting heads with the boy over her numerous sentinel house rules, Shadya quickly discovered there was much to like about him. He had guts <i>and</i> a conscience\u2014a combination seldom found in Marwi. Seeing the immense potential in the young man, Shadya made a deal with him: she would allow him to stay, free from the grasp of his countless enemies, and, in return, he would dedicate himself to the sentinel order.</p><p>Shadya and Akshan formed a fast bond as she taught him everything she knew about surviving as a solo sentinel. Akshan the scrappy street urchin grew into Akshan the full-grown bane of scoundrels. But even as Akshan\u2019s skills grew by the day, he could see his mentor growing more distant, and more troubled.</p><p>At last, Shadya told her pupil the reason for her concern: A Harrowing was coming, bigger than any the world had ever seen, bearing an army of wraiths and ghouls from the Shadow Isles. Their only hope of stopping the cataclysm rested with the ancient sentinel weapons that lay buried within Shurima's crypts and tombs. If the world was to be saved from ruination, they needed to collect these weapons, and <i>quickly</i>.</p><p>To Shadya\u2019s dismay, she found that the ancient weapons had already been plundered by local warlords. She pleaded with them to relinquish the artifacts for the fight against the inevitable Harrowing, but the warlords refused, determined to unlock the weapons\u2019 mysterious power for themselves.</p><p>With time running out, Akshan and Shadya were forced to make do with what they had. As they took stock of their arsenal, Akshan discovered a particularly striking gun hidden away in the base\u2019s vault. Alarmed, his mentor snatched it away and forbade Akshan from ever using it. The weapon, known as the Absolver, was imbued with an ancient enchantment that granted it a strange, unspeakable power\u2014it could take the life of a killer and, by doing so, restore their most recent victims to life.</p><p>\u201cIt must not be wielded by anyone,\u201d said Shadya. \u201cSuch matters of life and death are best left in the hands of fate.\u201d</p><p>But Akshan still bristled at sentinel rules, and he had even stronger opinions on fate. He had spent his whole life seeing good people horribly mistreated while bad people did as they pleased without consequence. If fate was real, it definitely needed help\u2014help that the Absolver could provide.</p><p>As his interest in the weapon deepened, Akshan continued to pry its history from Shadya and came to a shocking discovery: She had used the gun to save Akshan when she found him unconscious in the street all those years ago. With it, she\u2019d slain the criminal who had nearly killed him, and, in doing so, restored young Akshan to life. He wondered: Why did he alone deserve to be revived by the gun? Surely there were others who were more worthy.</p><p>While Akshan questioned the antiquated rules of his order, his mentor continued to press the warlords to turn over their stolen weapons. Tensions between the two parties built until one tragic day Akshan returned home to find Shadya murdered in the street, almost exactly where he had fallen all those years ago.</p><p>Akshan knew what he had to do. He made some key alterations to the Absolver and set out into the scorching desert with the forbidden weapon, hungry for vengeance. Though he could not determine which of the warlords had killed his mentor, he knew one way to be certain: he would pick them off one by one until Shadya was returned to Runeterra.</p>",

Though these fierce minotaurs had protected the overland trade routes to the ancient city of Zaun for centuries, they preferred to avoid Valoran\u2019s wider conflicts.</p><p>The noble warrior Alistar was respected among all the clans. Out on the mountain peaks, his roar could scatter even the bravest trespassers, leaving only the foolhardy to face him in combat. Even so, in the moot halls he would always urge his kin to forge greater bonds with other mortal races. Many saw minotaurs as little more than beasts, which soured any interaction and kept them firmly as outsiders.</p><p>Then Noxus came, promising something better. Their emissary, the matriarch of House Tewain, proclaimed that the empire was poised to take Basilich, a coastal city to the east. However, she pledged that they would not do this without the support of the great clans of the mountains, and called for parley on neutral ground.</p><p>Many of the minotaurs were eager to accept her offer. This was a way to gain the power and recognition they sought, by joining with Noxus.</p><p>But Alistar remained skeptical\u2014he had encountered many Noxian scouts in recent years, and knew them to be a duplicitous and cunning people. For this reason, his clan sent him to meet Tewain, along with fifty of their mightiest warriors, to reject any alliance. The other clans could do as they wished, but Alistar would not accept the rule of some distant \u201cGrand General\u201d.</p><p>Under the banners of truce, he and his kin were betrayed.</p><p>The larger clans had already pledged themselves to Noxus, and their representatives turned against him as soon as he made his position known. The battle was swift and bloody, and Alistar himself crushed Lady Tewain\u2019s skull with his bare hands\u2014but soon enough he and his surviving warriors found themselves bound in chains, headed for the distant Noxian capital, accused of inciting rebellion.</p><p>These unfortunate minotaurs found themselves cast into the Reckoning arenas of the capital, as part of a grim gladiatorial festival known as the Fleshing.</p><p>Alistar was appalled by the chanting of the bloodthirsty spectators. He implored his clanfolk not to fight back, not to give these Noxians the monstrous display they so craved\u2026</p><p>When the festival ended twenty-one days later, Alistar was the only member of his tribe left. Pelted with pebbles and rotten fruit from the crowd, dragged out to face Reckoner after Reckoner, he was driven to fight like a beast\u2014and think like one. He killed and killed until even his memories of home became stained with blood.</p><p>Alistar had fallen far by the time he met Ayelia, a servant girl in the arenas. At first he bellowed and charged the bars of his cage, expecting her to fear or goad him like the others, but Ayelia did neither.</p><p>She returned every day, and spoke to him with gentle respect, until eventually Alistar answered in kind. Ayelia\u2019s homeland had also been claimed by Noxus, and seeing his suffering had convinced her they should leave this hateful city together. She whispered her plans through the bars, and for the first time in years Alistar found he could think of home without dwelling on the way it had been taken from him.</p><p>One night, Ayelia brought Alistar the key to his cell. She had sacrificed much to arrange this escape, and he swore he would repay her tenfold.</p><p>They hurried to the river, where a cargo barge awaited them. However, as they boarded, Noxian agents burst from the shadows. Alistar hurled himself into battle, his vision tunneled with rage, and although Ayelia called out to him again and again, he did not hear.</p><p>By the time Alistar had slain their attackers, the boat was gone\u2014and Ayelia with it\u2014so he fled south on foot instead. He searched everywhere for the servant girl, but found nothing. Had she been captured? Killed? It seemed there were no clues left to find.</p><p>Weeks later, a political coup shook the empire to its dark foundations, and the arena minotaur\u2019s escape was quite forgotten.</p><p>Alistar now travels alone, as quietly and anonymously as he can, encouraging resistance in Noxian-held territories and fighting on behalf of the downtrodden and the abused. Only when he has cleared the shame from his heart, repaying every cruelty and every kindness, will Alistar return to the mountains and leave his rage behind.</p><p>And in every city he passes through, he asks after Ayelia.</p>",

Though he was enslaved and forced into the life of a gladiator, his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly becoming a beast. Now, free of the chains of his former masters, he fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, his rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.",

Cursed by an ancient spell, he is doomed to remain alone forever, as his touch is death and his affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe Amumu as a living cadaver, small in stature and covered in bandages the color of lichen. Amumu has inspired myths, folklore, and legends told and retold for generations \u2013 such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.</p><p>The hardy folk of Shurima agree upon certain things: the wind always blows from the west in the morning; a full belly on a new moon is an ill omen; buried treasure hides under the heaviest of rocks. They do not agree, however, about the tale of Amumu.</p><p>One oft-told story links Amumu to the first great ruling family of Shurima who succumbed to a disease that corrupted flesh with hideous speed. The youngest child, Amumu, was quarantined in his chambers and befriended a servant girl who heard his cries through the walls. She regaled the lonely heir with courtly news and stories of her grandmother\u2019s mystic powers.</p><p>One morning, the girl brought word that Amumu\u2019s last remaining brother had passed away, making him Emperor of Shurima. Saddened that he had to bear this news alone, she unlocked his door and ran inside to comfort him face to face. Amumu threw his arms around her, but as they touched, he fell back, realizing he had condemned her to the same terrible fate as his family.</p><p>Upon the girl\u2019s death, her grandmother placed a twisted blight on the young emperor. In her mind, Amumu had as good as murdered her kin. As the curse took effect, Amumu was trapped in his moment of suffering like a locust ensnared in honeyed amber.</p><p>A second tale whispers of another crown prince, one given to bouts of petulance, cruelty, and murderous vanity. In this telling, Amumu was crowned Emperor of Shurima at a young age, and convinced he was blessed by the sun, he forced his subjects to worship him as a god.</p><p>Amumu sought the fabled Eye of Angor, an ancient relic entombed in a gilded crypt, said to grant eternal life to whoever looked upon it with an unflinching heart. He hunted the treasure for years with a host of slaves who carried him through labyrinthine catacombs, sacrificing themselves to traps so the emperor could continue without hindrance. Amumu finally reached the cyclopean golden archway, where upon dozens of his stonemasons labored to breach the sealed door.</p><p>As the young emperor rushed within, determined to look into the Eye of Angor, his slaves seized their chance and sealed the stone doorway behind him. Some say the child emperor endured in the darkness for years, his loneliness driving him to insanity and causing him to claw at his own skin, which he was forced to wrap in bandages. His life was extended by the power of the Eye as he meditated on his past transgressions, but the gift was a double edged sword, for he was cursed to remain forever alone.</p><p>When a series of devastating earthquakes shattered the foundations of his tomb, the emperor escaped with no knowledge of how much time had passed, seeking to undo the suffering he had caused in life.</p><p>Yet another story of Amumu tells of the first and last Yordle ruler of Shurima, who believed in the innate goodness of the human heart. To prove his detractors wrong, he swore an oath to live as a beggar until he made one true friend, convinced his people would rally to help their fellow Shuriman.</p><p>Though thousands walked by the disheveled Yordle, not one stopped to offer a helping hand. Amumu\u2019s sadness grew until he eventually died of a broken heart. But his death was not the end, for some swear the Yordle still wanders the desert, forever searching for someone who might restore his faith in humanity.</p><p>These stories, despite their differences, are woven with parallels. Whatever the circumstances, Amumu is doomed to exist in a broken state of emptiness, eternally alone and friendless. Fated to forever search for a companion, his presence is cursed and his touch is death. On long winter nights when the fire is never allowed to burn low, the sad mummy can sometimes be heard weeping in the desert, despairing that he\u2019ll never know the solace of friendship.</p><p>Whatever Amumu searches for \u2013 atonement, kinship, or a single act of kindness \u2013 one thing is as certain as the western wind at dawn: he has yet to find it.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Anivia is an ancient Freljordian demi-god who represents the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth, intrinsically associated with the changing seasons. To those who venerate her, she is the elemental soul of the Freljord\u2014a symbol of hope, and a sacred catalyst of change.</p><p>Stories passed down through the ages often tell of how she rewards those who are kind and humble. On the rare occasion a mortal glimpses her\u2014or at least <i>claims</i> to\u2014she is described as a noble spirit-bird of ice, with glittering wings that span the heavens, and a piercing cry that can be heard over even the fiercest storm.</p><p>The songs of the nomadic Notai tribe tell how Anivia\u2019s birth first brought snow into the world. When she burst from her giant egg of ice, tiny pieces of it were hurled into the sky, and it has fallen as snow ever since. And, according to the sagas of the Mourncrow tribe, the frigid winds that scour the Freljord originate from the first beats of her wings.</p><p>Indeed, the full power of winter is Anivia\u2019s to command, and to those who seek to desecrate her homeland, she is a bitter foe. When roused to anger, she can cleave fortresses and mountains, and her screech can summon blizzards cold enough to shatter steel.</p><p>One of the most enduring and respected beliefs is that Anivia\u2019s greatest gift to the Freljord was the creation of True Ice. Infused with elemental magic, this unmelting substance is pure and potent, and the greatest seers and ice-mages have long strived to use shards of True Ice to amplify their might, while weapons that have even a tiny sliver forged into them are deadly beyond belief.</p><p>When mortals first arrived in the Freljord, Anivia welcomed them. Seeing that they could not withstand the cold, she guided them to secluded valleys where they could shelter, become established, and slowly harden themselves against the elements. She nurtured and watched over them for those first precarious centuries\u2014and they, in turn, worshipped her.</p><p>Anivia hoped that these newly arrived tribes would remain unified in defending the Freljord from outsiders\u2026 but slowly, infighting and blood-feuds became all too common, making an invasion inevitable. According to legend, a greedy southern king marched his warriors up through the mountains, seeking to claim dominion over the northlands and shackle their wild magic for himself. So enraged was Anivia at the outsiders\u2019 hubris and disrespect that she blasted them with a snowstorm that lasted a century and a day. Scattered standing stones can still be seen on the Scouring Plain, which the locals claim are all that remain of that ancient army.</p><p>Other tales include the Avarosan legend of Ulla Shatter-Spear, an Iceborn warmother who was favored by Anivia for saving a young hawk from a rimefang wolf. Across her lifetime, the Cryophoenix protected Ulla from harm, and when she finally fell in battle, having witnessed almost a hundred winters, it is said that Anivia welcomed her with wings spread wide.</p><p>If all these legends are true, then Anivia must have witnessed the rise and fall of <i>countless</i> mortal civilizations. While there are still some dwindling remnants of those earlier times, most have long been forgotten, and buried beneath millennia of ice.</p><p>But death cannot touch Anivia herself. The sagas speak of how she has been struck down and slain a handful of times throughout history, though she is always reborn\u2014for as long as the Freljord exists, her soul is immortal. While it may be hundreds or even thousands of years before she rises again, each rebirth coincides with the dawning of a new era. Thus, her appearance, while regarded as a wondrous blessing, is often the harbinger of something terrible on the horizon.</p><p>Once, it is said, she sacrificed herself against a march of towering Balestriders. Anvia knew she could not slay these colossal creatures, and so she plunged into the ice beneath their feet, shattering her own body in order to entomb them.</p><p>Recently, some claim Anivia has hatched from the egg once more, and that she has appeared before the new leader of the Avarosans\u2014the Warmother Ashe. In her, perhaps Anivia sees one who may be able to finally reunite the Freljord.</p><p>Yet if the Cryophoenix has indeed returned, as more and more shamans and spirit walkers proclaim, then it must be asked: what great threat has she come to face?</p>",

Gregori the Gray and his wife, a witch by the name of Amoline, preferred to demonstrate their Noxian strength by taming the borderlands, rather than partaking in the political intrigue of the noble houses.</p> <p>The young couple claimed a piece of land beyond the Ironspike Mountains to the north, finishing their small home just before winter and the arrival of their first child. During their journey, other colonists\u2019 tales of the great shadow bears that once roamed the territory had captivated Amoline\u2014now heavily pregnant, she passed the time sitting near the fireplace, creating a toy version of the protective creatures. Just as she finished sewing the last button eye on the stuffed bear, the quickening of labor overcame her. Gregori remarked later that his daughter was eager to play with her new toy, for there, on an ember-warmed hearth, Amoline brought Annie into the world.</p><p>When Annie was still a toddler, she and her father took ill. As night fell, Annie began to burn with fever, and soon she was so hot, she could no longer be held in her mother\u2019s arms. Amoline grew desperate, deciding at last to fetch icy water from the nearby river. The next morning Gregori awoke, weak and groggy from his sickness. In the crib, a now-healthy Annie played with her stuffed bear, Tibbers, but Amoline was gone.</p><p>Na\u00efvely, Annie believed her mother would one day return. Gregori would often find the girl sitting in her mother\u2019s rocking chair near the hearth, hugging Tibbers and staring into a crackling fire, where he was sure there had been nothing but cold ashes. He chalked up these slips of the mind to the burden of parenting a child alone.</p> <p>Years passed, bringing more colonists to the region. And in time, Gregori met Leanna, a woman seeking a new life outside the capital with her own young daughter, Daisy.</p><p>Annie was eager for a playmate, but spoiled by the indulgences of being an only child, so acclimation to her new stepfamily was difficult. Whenever Annie\u2019s fiery temper erupted, it left Leanna uneasy, and quick to take her own daughter\u2019s side. It fell to Gregori to keep an uneasy peace between the three.</p> <p>Unused to the dangers of the untamed borderlands, Daisy\u2019s playing ended in catastrophe for the family. Leanna, of course, blamed Annie for the loss of her daughter, focusing her rage and grief on her stepdaughter\u2019s most prized possession: Tibbers. Annie was horrified as the last physical memory of her mother was threatened. The girl\u2019s terror grew to an unbridled rage, releasing her latent and powerful pyromancy, and the stuffed bear was brought to life in a maelstrom of protective fire.</p><p>When the flames died down and the swirl of ash settled, Annie was left orphaned and alone.</p><p>Believing most city adults to be like her stepmother, Annie has kept to the wilder parts of her frontier homeland. On occasion, she will use her disarmingly adorable exterior to be taken in by some pioneer family long enough to be offered new clothes and a hot meal. However, fire and death awaits anyone foolish enough to try parting Annie from the stuffed bear at her side.</p><p>Kept safe by Tibbers, she wanders the dark forests of Noxus, oblivious to danger\u2014and the dangers posed to others by her own unchecked power\u2014hoping, one day, to find someone like her to play with.</p>",

Even in the shadows of the mountains north of Noxus, she is a magical outlier. Her natural affinity for fire manifested early in life through unpredictable, emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to control these \u201cplayful tricks.\u201d Her favorite includes the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers, as a fiery protector. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood, Annie wanders the dark forests, always looking for someone to play with.</p>",

Zealously devout, they grew up within a faith of mystery, reflection, and discovery, and embraced darkness not just out of belief, but as the only thing that could keep them safe.</p><p>The Solari who ruled Targon considered the Lunari heretics, driving them into hiding until most forgot the Lunari even existed. The Lunari were left to the shadows, dwelling in temples and caves far from the Solaris\u2019 sight.</p><p>The pressure to be exemplary weighed heavily upon Aphelios. He practiced tirelessly with mystical moonstone blades, spilling his own blood in training so he could spill that of others to protect the faith. Intense and vulnerable, he bonded deeply with his sister in lieu of any other friendships.</p><p>While Aphelios was sent on increasingly dangerous missions to protect the Lunari, Alune trained separately as a seer, using her luminous magic to reveal hidden pathways and truths by the moon\u2019s light. In time, her tasks required her to leave the temple where they were raised.</p><p>Without Alune, Aphelios\u2019 faith wavered.</p><p>Desperate for purpose, he undertook a ceremonial journey into darkness where Lunari were said to discover their paths\u2014their orbits. He followed the moon\u2019s light to a pool where rare noctum flowers bloomed beneath the water\u2019s surface. Though poisonous, the flowers could be distilled into a liquid that opened him to the night\u2019s power.</p><p>Drinking the noctum\u2019s essence, Aphelios felt so much pain that it numbed him to everything else.</p><p>Soon after, an ancient temple, the Marus Omegnum, began to come into phase from the spirit realm for the first time in centuries. Lunari from across the mountain gathered, emerging from hiding to witness the balance of power shift as celestial cycles in the heavens turned.</p><p>The fortress accepted only one occupant, gifted in magic, each time it appeared. This time it would be Alune, her orbit guiding her to the temple. Aphelios, usually asking for nothing, requested to attend the event.</p><p>But as the fortress passed through the veil in a luminous display of magic, a harsher radiance filled the night. Somehow, the Lunari had been discovered even as the celestial cycles turned in their favor.</p><p>An army of Solari descended upon them.</p><p>All seemed lost, the Solari purging the Lunari heresy with fire and steel. Even Aphelios was beaten, his moonstone blades shattered on the ground, blood spilling from his lips as he reached for the noctum\u2026</p><p>But as the battle raged, Alune traveled deeper into the temple\u2014and when she reached its heart, her full potential unlocked. Through the noctum, Aphelios could feel Alune\u2019s power embrace him\u2026 and he could hear her voice. With a whisper, she pushed magic into his hands\u2014a replacement for his blades solidifying into moonstone.</p><p>Like the moon of stone and its spiritual reflection, Aphelios\u2019s skill and Alune\u2019s magic converged.</p><p>Those Solari would not live to see the sun again.</p><p>As her power flared, Alune pushed the temple, and herself within, back into the spirit realm where it would remain safe from the Solari. From inside, amplified by the temple\u2019s focusing power, Alune was able to project her magic anywhere, so long as it found a focus\u2014like the poison coursing through Aphelios\u2019 veins.</p><p>Only now did they understand their destiny. Aphelios would hollow himself out with pain, but would become a conduit for the moon\u2019s power. Alune would live alone, isolated in her fortress, but she would guide her brother, able to see through his eyes.</p><p>Together, they would be the weapon the Lunari needed, bound by pain and sacrifice. Only apart could they be together\u2014their souls brushing across the veil, distant, yet impossibly close, converging into something they could not understand.</p><p>To protect the survivors of the attack who retreated back into the shadows of the mountain, Aphelios\u2019 training as an assassin has been given reach by Alune\u2019s magic\u2014his blades now an arsenal of mystical weapons, perfected by Alune over the course of many missions together.</p><p>Now that the power balance of Targon is shifting, and the Solari know the Lunari still endure, Aphelios and Alune are needed more than ever.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Ashe hails from the northern Freljord, where brutal tribal raids and inter-clan warfare are as much a part of the landscape as the scream of the frozen winds, and the unyielding cold of the tundra.</p><p>The only child of Grena, the matriarchal chieftain of the tiny Avarosan tribe, Ashe was <i>Iceborn</i>: a member of the warrior caste, gifted with an ancestral connection to the magic of her lands, and the rare ability to wield the power of True Ice. Everyone assumed that Ashe would follow her mother as the tribe's next leader. However, this was never a glory Ashe desired. The grim responsibility of her warlike lineage and extraordinary gifts instead left Ashe feeling isolated, burdened, and alone.</p><p>Her only respite was when Sejuani, an Iceborn girl from a sister tribe, would stay with them for the summer hunts around the Ornnkaal Rocks. The girls' friendship defined their childhoods, but was cut short just as they reached their teens. Somehow, Grena had offended Sejuani's grandmother, and the fellowship between their tribes ended suddenly.</p><p>Soon after, with her youth fading, Ashe's mother began her lifelong quest for the \u201cThrone of Avarosa\u201d, a supposed hoard of treasures and magical items that she hoped would return her people to greatness.</p><p>But Grena\u2019s belief in prophecies and legends led her to take risks, which often left her tribe enfeebled. Finally, during a dangerous and unnecessary raid in another tribe's lands, Grena was killed. Her sudden death left young Ashe on the run, while most of her tribe was wiped out.</p><p>Alone, pursued, Ashe followed her mother's last map to a deserted glacier where she found the supposed grave of Avarosa, and her magical bow of True Ice. Ashe used the weapon to avenge her mother's death, then turned west.</p><p>Whether it was out of duty or loneliness, Ashe gained a reputation by protecting the many scattered hearthbound tribes she encountered. She spurned the custom of taking thralls, and instead chose to adopt these desperate people as full members of her new tribe, and her fame grew quickly. Soon many began to believe that she did not just carry the weapon of Avarosa\u2014Ashe <i>was</i> the legend herself, reborn and destined to reunite the Freljord.</p><p>But tall tales would not feed her followers, and their long march south left the tribe on the verge of starvation. So, Ashe leveraged the myths surrounding her, using them to form alliances with the powerful and land-rich southern tribes, promising to unite them into a nation capable of challenging neighboring kingdoms.</p><p>These new alliances brought new dangers, and Ashe quickly found herself at the center of a political feud. A Warmother, as Freljordian tribal leaders are known, was expected to wed, and taking a husband from one of the major tribes would anger the others. Ashe could take several husbands, but this would only bring the conflict to a boil within her own household, and the ensuing bloodshed would shatter the alliances she had fought to build.</p><p>Her answer was an impoverished vagabond from a mountain clan that had been nearly wiped out\u2014the warrior Tryndamere. He was neither a spirit-walker nor blessed with any elemental powers, but upon his arrival in Ashe\u2019s new capital, Tryndamere had thrown himself into every dueling ring he could find. He fought with abandon, desperate to prove the destitute survivors of his clan were worthy of adoption by one of the stronger tribes. But even for the Freljord, his brutal fighting style and extraordinary vitality were unsettling, and many suspected he was touched by dark magic. Ignoring this, Ashe offered to adopt his people as her own, if he became her first and only bloodsworn.</p><p>Tryndamere accepted reluctantly. Though a political marriage, the attraction they felt for each other was palpable, and slowly a true affection blossomed.</p><p>Now, Ashe stands at the head of the largest coalition of Freljordian tribes in many generations. Even so, the unity she would bring rests upon an uneasy peace threatened by internal intrigues, foreign powers, the growing violent horde of the Winter's Claw, and a supposed destiny that Ashe must at least <i>pretend</i> to believe\u2026</p>",

Under the auspices of such fiery harbingers, new empires rise, old cultures fall, and even the stars themselves may vanish from the heavens\u2026</p><p>The truth is, perhaps, more unsettling.</p><p>The almighty being known as Aurelion Sol was already ancient before the rise of the mortal races of Runeterra. Born in the first breath of creation, he and those like him roamed the vast nothingness of a pristine celestial realm, seeking to fill this canvas of incalculable breadth with marvels whose twinkling spectra would bring fulfillment and delight to all who witnessed them.</p><p>As he wandered, Aurelion Sol seldom encountered any equals. The eternal Aspects were dispassionate and incurious things, contributing little to existence, content only to compose amusingly self-centered philosophies on the nature of creation.</p><p>But then, bathed in the light of a fairly unremarkable sun he had crafted eons earlier, he discovered something. A world. New realms.</p><p>He did not know who had created this world, or why\u2014only that it had not been him.</p><p>The Aspects, who seemed unusually invested in it, implored him to come closer. There was life here, and magic, and fledgling civilizations that cried out for guidance from beings greater than themselves. Flattered by this new audience to his supreme majesty, Aurelion Sol descended to bask in their adulation, in the form of a vast and terrible dragon from the stars.</p><p>The tiny inhabitants of the insignificant land of Targon named him for the golden light of the sun he had gifted them, and the Aspects commanded them to bring forth a suitable offering in return. The mortals climbed to the peak of their tallest mountain, and presented him with a splendorous crown, crafted with careful and cunning magic, and etched with the inscrutable patterns of the celestial realm.</p><p>From the moment it touched Aurelion Sol\u2019s brow, he knew this was no gift at all.</p><p>The accursed thing clamped in place with unimaginable force, enough that even he could not remove it, and he could feel his knowledge of the sun and its creation being stolen and scrutinized by intelligences vastly inferior to his own. Worse still, the power of the crown hurled him back into the heavens, and prevented him from getting any closer to that world again.</p><p>Instead, he was forced to watch as the duplicitous Aspects of Targon set the mortals to work in the construction of a great, gleaming disc. With this, they channeled <i>his</i> celestial power to raise up immortal god-warriors, for some unknown conflict that was apparently still to come.</p><p>Outraged, Aurelion Sol could see other stars fading across the firmament for lack of care and maintenance, and he strained to break free of the crown\u2019s control. It was he who had birthed their light into the universe! Why must he be shackled, now, by the Aspects and their lowly pawns? He roared with glee when the Sun Disc failed\u2026 only to see a second, more powerful one take its place. Eventually, resigned to his fate, he saw the god-warriors cast down their rivals, then chittering creatures of pure darkness, and eventually each other.</p><p>Then, in little more than the blink of a star dragon\u2019s eye, the world was ravaged by a succession of sorcerous catastrophes, and Aurelion Sol finally knew that Targon and the hated Aspects were all but defenseless. As he cautiously circled back, he realized the magic that bound him was weakening. Flecks of gold began to fall from his crown, each one blazing across the skies like a comet.</p><p>Driven by the tantalizing possibilities of freedom and revenge, Aurelion Sol now regards Runeterra with simmering, eternal fury. Surely, it is here, upon this world, that the cosmic balance will tip in his favor once more\u2014and with it, the universe itself shall bear witness to the fate of those who dare steal the power of a star forger.</p>",

Running parallel is the spirit realm, invisible to many and just as vibrant and full of life. Yet deep in the frozen tundra of the Freljord, there is a vastaya who lives in a blended world of her own...</p>\n<p>Aurora was born in the secluded village of Aamu, home to the Bryni tribe, and spent her youth playing with critters no one else could see while exploring a world no one else could appreciate. Though she was happy, she felt isolated from the rest of Aamu. Even her parents didn\u2019t understand her, believing Aurora\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d were merely imaginary.</p>\n<p>The only Bryni who wholeheartedly embraced Aurora was her great aunt Havu, who always entertained her stories, fostered her passions, and encouraged her to celebrate her individuality. So Aurora learned to be herself and revel in her own company.</p>\n<p>As Aurora grew older, she realized something: Her invisible friends were not imaginary, but spirits. The beautiful, vibrant world she lived in was completely unique, for only <em>her </em>eyes could pierce through the veil between the realm of mortals and spirits.</p>\n<p>She meticulously documented this intertwined world, studying Aamu's spirits in hopes of helping others understand the realms as she saw them.</p>\n<p>Over time, more and more spirits appeared in Aamu, including ones who felt\u2026 different. Lost and wild, they had become \"wayward\" when the balance between realms was disturbed by mortal affairs. But after investigating this phenomenon, Aurora discovered she could help these spirits return home by getting to the root of their pain.</p>\n<p>This was difficult work, but in it, Aurora found her life's purpose.</p>\n<p>She knew that continuing her research meant she had to explore the world outside of Aamu. Though the idea of change made her nervous, the prospect of expanding her knowledge inspired Aurora to leave her home behind.</p>\n<p>It was during her travels that she encountered a wayward spirit who took the form of a monstrous, twisted elk. He was feral and afraid, lashing out with bloodstained antlers. Aurora was determined to calm him down, and though it took time, she earned his trust. But this spirit was unlike the others\u2014with every attempt to help him, Aurora failed. Undeterred, she convinced the afflicted elk to travel with her, using her powers to tuck him away in the spirit realm as she worked to unravel his mystery.</p>\n<p>Having come across a number of spirit walkers as she traversed the Freljord, Aurora sought their advice, believing their ability to channel spirits may shed some light on what plagued her wayward companion. However, they too were at a loss, suggesting she find Udyr, the tundra\u2019s most powerful spirit walker.</p>\n<p>Udyr needed just one look to recognize the immense power of Aurora's spirit friend, but the fearsome elk was too lost to commune with. Instead, he encouraged her to ask the demigods for answers. </p>\n<p>Aurora decided to first search for the Great Ram, Ornn. She traveled far through ice and snow to study the artifacts of his followers, the Hearthblood, hoping to learn where they had worshiped him. Only through her persistent research was she at last able to discern the location of Hearth-Home\u2014but where once stood a grand settlement was nothing but ruin and rubble.</p>\n<p>Aurora knew this was not as it appeared. Using her ability to open a doorway between realms, she stepped inside and was met with the great hall of Ornn's forge, alive with roaring fire.</p>\n<p>Ornn was not receptive to his new visitor\u2014but in time, he realized that she, like him, valued solitude and quiet. As he grew to trust her, Ornn finally shared the name of Aurora\u2019s companion: Haestryr. One of Ornn's siblings, Hestrelk, as he was once commonly called, was originally a powerful demigod, but with the waning worship of the Old Gods, many demigods had lost their identities and become distorted shadows of who they once were.</p>\n<p>This revelation about her wayward friend brought Aurora one step closer to helping him find his way home, but there was still a long journey ahead of her.</p>\n<p>From Ornn, she learned about Ysjarn, the cryophoenix who guides and protects the land while enduring an eternal cycle of birth, life, and death. And, though painful, Ornn also spoke of his brother Valhir, whose relentless storm rages against the Freljord in his desperation to quench the Vorrijaard's bloodlust with the rains of war.</p>\n<p>Believing these demigods hold the key to Hestrelk\u2019s recovery, Aurora has left Hearth-Home and now traverses through the material and spirit realms of her frozen homeland in unwavering pursuit of their knowledge.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>From the moment she was born, Aurora navigated life with a unique ability to move between the spirit and material realms. Determined to learn more about the spirit realm's inhabitants, she left her home to further her research and happened upon a wayward demigod who\u2019d become twisted and lost to time. Witnessing his desperation, Aurora resolved to find a way to help her feral friend regain his forgotten identity\u2014a journey that would take her to the farthest reaches of the Freljord.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, the Shuriman empire was a sprawling realm of vassal states conquered by powerful armies led by all but invincible warriors known as the Ascended. Ruled by an ambitious and power hungry emperor, Shurima was the greatest realm of its day; a fertile land blessed by the power of the sun that shone from a great golden disc floating atop the temple at the heart of its capital.</p><p>The youngest and least-favored son of the emperor, Azir was never destined for greatness. With so many siblings ahead of him, he would never be emperor. Most likely he would take up a position in the priesthood or as governor of some backwater province. He was a slender, studious boy who spent more time perusing the texts collected in the Great Library of Nasus than training to fight under the stern tutelage of the Ascended hero, Renekton.</p><p>Amid the twisting shelves of scrolls, books and tablets, Azir met a young slave boy who visited the library almost every day in search of texts desired by his master. Slaves in Shurima were forbidden to take names, but as the two boys became friends, Azir broke that law and called his new friend Xerath, which means \u2018one who shares.\u2019 He appointed Xerath - though he was careful never to endanger him by naming him publicly - as his personal slave and the two boys shared their love of history by learning all they could of Shurima\u2019s past and its long legacy of Ascended heroes.</p><p>While traveling with his father, brothers and Renekton on the yearly tour of the empire, the royal caravan stopped at a well-known oasis for the night. Azir and Xerath stole away in the middle of the night to draw the stars and add their own celestial maps to those they had studied in the Great Library. While they drew the patterns of constellations, the royal caravan was attacked by a cabal of assassins sent by the emperor\u2019s enemies. One of the assassins found the two boys out in the desert and was poised to cut Azir\u2019s throat when Xerath intervened, throwing himself upon the assassin\u2019s back. In the ensuing melee, Azir freed his dagger and plunged it into his attacker\u2019s throat.</p><p>Azir took up the dead man\u2019s sword and rushed back to the oasis, but by the time he returned, the assassins were already defeated. Renekton had protected the emperor and slain the attackers, but Azir\u2019s brothers were all dead. Azir told his father of Xerath\u2019s courage and asked him to reward the slave boy, but his words fell on deaf ears. In the emperor\u2019s eyes, the boy was a slave and beneath his notice, but Azir swore that one day he and Xerath would be brothers.</p><p>The emperor returned to his capital, with the fifteen year old Azir now his heir, and unleashed a merciless campaign of bloodshed against those he believed had sent the assassins. Shurima descended into years of paranoia and murder as the emperor took revenge on any he suspected of treason. Though he was now heir to the throne, Azir\u2019s life yet hung by a thread. His father hated him - wishing he had died instead of his brothers - and the queen was still young enough to bear sons.</p><p>Azir trained in combat, for the attack at the oasis had revealed how little he knew of the deadly arts. Renekton took up the task of teaching the growing prince, and under his aegis, Azir learned to wield sword and spear, to command warriors, and to read the ebb and flow of battle. The young heir elevated Xerath, his only trusted confidant, and made him his right hand man. To better counsel him, Azir tasked Xerath with seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it.</p><p>Years passed, but the queen was never able to carry a child to term, every conceived infant perishing before it could be born. So long as the queen remained barren, Azir\u2019s life was relatively safe. Some around the court believed a curse was at work and a few even whispered the young heir\u2019s name in connection with this \u2013 though Azir claimed innocence and even executed some who dared voice such accusations openly.</p><p>Eventually, the queen bore a healthy son, but on the night of his birth a terrible storm engulfed Shurima. The queen\u2019s chambers were struck again and again by powerful bolts of lightning, and in the subsequent blaze, both the queen and her newborn son were killed. It was said the emperor went mad with grief and took his own life upon hearing the news, but tales soon spread of how he and his guards had been found lying in pieces on the palace floor, their bodies little more than charred skeletons.</p><p>Azir was shocked by their deaths, but the empire needed a leader, and with Xerath at his side he took control of Shurima as its emperor. Over the next decade, he expanded Shurima\u2019s borders and ruled with a harsh, but just hand. He instituted reforms to better the lives of slaves and privately developed a plan to overturn millennia of tradition and eventually free them all. He kept his plans secret, even from Xerath, and the issue of slavery would prove to be a continual bone of contention between them. The empire had been built on the back of slavery, and many of the great noble houses depended on enforced labor for their vast wealth and power. Such monolithic institutions could not be overturned overnight, and Azir\u2019s plans would be undone were they to become common knowledge. Despite Azir\u2019s desire to name Xerath his brother, he could not do so until all Shurima\u2019s slaves were free.</p><p>Through these years, Xerath protected Azir from his political rivals and guided the expansion of the empire. Azir married and fathered numerous children, some by wedlock, others by ill-advised liaisons with slaves and harem girls. Xerath stoked the emperor\u2019s grand vision of an empire greater than any the world had ever known. But to stand as ruler over the entire world, Xerath convinced Azir that he would need to be all but invincible, a god amongst men \u2013 an Ascended being.</p><p>As the kingdom reached the zenith of its power, Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that the time was right for him to take his place alongside Nasus and Renekton and their glorious forebears. Many questioned this decision; the Ascension ritual was highly dangerous and intended only for those near the end of their lives, those who had devoted their lives to Shurima and whose service was to be honored with Ascension. It was for the Sun Priests to decree who would be blessed with Ascension, not the hubris of an emperor to bestow it upon himself. Azir would not be dissuaded from his rash course of action, for his arrogance had grown along with his empire, and he ordered them to comply on pain of death.</p><p>The day of the ritual finally came and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension, flanked by thousands of his warriors and tens of thousands of his subjects. The brothers Renekton and Nasus were absent, having been dispatched by Xerath to deal with an emergent threat, but still Azir would not turn from what he saw as his great destiny. He climbed to the great golden disc atop the temple at the heart of the city and in the moments before the sun priests began the ritual, he turned to Xerath and finally freed him. And not just him, but all slaves\u2026</p><p>Xerath was stunned into speechlessness, but Azir was not yet done. He embraced Xerath and named him his eternal brother, as he had promised he would all those years ago. Azir turned as the priests began the ritual to bring down the awesome power of the sun. Azir was unaware that Xerath had studied more than just history and philosophy in his quest for knowledge. He had learned the dark arts of sorcery, all the while nursing a desire for freedom that had grown like a cancer into a burning hatred.</p><p>At the height of the ritual, the former slave unleashed his powers and Azir was blasted from his place on the dais. Without the protection of the runic circle, Azir was consumed by the sun\u2019s fire as Xerath took his place. The light filled Xerath with power, and he roared as his mortal body began to transform.</p><p>But the magic of the ritual was not intended for Xerath, and such awesomely powerful celestial energies could not be diverted without dire consequence. The power of the Ascension ritual exploded outward, devastating Shurima and laying waste to the city. Its people burned to ash and its towering palaces fell to ruin as the desert sands rose up to swallow the city. The sun disc sank from the sky and what had taken centuries to build was brought to ruin in an instant by one man\u2019s ambition and another\u2019s misplaced hate. All that remained of Azir\u2019s city were sunken ruins and echoes of its people\u2019s screams on the night winds.</p><p>Azir saw none of this. For him, all was nothingness. His last memories were of pain and fire; he knew nothing of what befell him atop the temple, nor what became of his empire. He remained lost in timeless oblivion until, thousands of years after Shurima\u2019s doom, the blood of his last descendant spilled onto the temple ruins and resurrected him. Azir was reborn, but was yet incomplete; his body little more than animate dust given form, held together by the last vestiges of his indomitable will.</p><p>Gradually resuming his corporeal form, Azir stumbled through the ruins and came across the corpse of a woman with a treacherous knife wound in her back. He did not know her, but saw in her features the distant echo of his bloodline. All thoughts of empires and power were forgotten as he lifted this daughter of Shurima and bore her to what had once been the Oasis of the Dawn. The oasis was empty and dry, but with every step Azir took, clear water began filling the rocky basin. Azir immersed the woman\u2019s body in the restorative waters of the oasis and as the blood washed away, only a faint scar remained where the blade had pierced her.</p><p>And with that act of selflessness, Azir was lifted up in a column of fire as the magic of Shurima renewed him, remaking him as the Ascended being he was meant to become. The sun\u2019s immortal radiance poured into him, crafting his magnificent, hawk-armored form and granting him the power to command the very sand itself. Azir lifted his arms and his ruined city shrugged off the dust of centuries spent beneath the desert to rise anew. The sun disc lifted into the sky once more, and healing waters flowed between temples heaving themselves back into the light at the emperor\u2019s command.</p><p>Azir climbed the steps of the newly-risen sun temple, weaving the desert winds to recreate the city\u2019s last moments. Ghosts formed of sand relived his city\u2019s last moments from long ago, and Azir watched in horror as Xerath\u2019s treachery unfolded. He wept as he saw his family murdered, his empire fall and his power stolen. Only now, millennia too late, did he finally understand the depths of hatred harbored by his former friend and ally. With the power and prescience of an Ascended being, Azir sensed Xerath somewhere abroad in the world and summoned an army of sand warriors to march alongside their reborn emperor. As the sun blazed from the golden disc above him, Azir swore a mighty oath.</p><p>I will reclaim my lands and take back what was mine!</p>",

However, for one prodigious entity, the intangible and everlasting beauty of this dimension is not seen, but heard\u2014for Bard, a troubadour as enigmatic as he is eternal, the wondrous firmament is a symphony of mystic, ambrosial music.</p><p>In the beginning, Bard had drifted without purpose or perspective through a silent cosmos, but with a deep sense of anticipation that <i>something</i> miraculous would eventually come to fill it. Fate did not disappoint, and with the forging of the first stars, the silence was broken and the first rapturous notes of creation rang in Bard\u2019s ear.</p><p>He traveled the swirling harmonies between the stars, along with the tiniest wisps of residual inspiration and thought left over from their birth. These semitonal, incomplete motes of energy\u2014or <i>meeps</i>\u2014were drawn to him whenever he added his own voice to the cosmic opus, forever ringing in one perfect accord.</p><p>This was not <i>his</i> masterpiece, yet he gloried in it all the same.</p><p>But after a measureless interval, a dissonance began to creep in. It was so small at first, Bard might have missed it, but the ever-doting meeps drew his attention to a failed dynamic shift here, an unexpected syncopation there, and even the growing absence of sound where, before, sound had been.</p><p>Bard scoured the celestial realm for clues, until he discovered the source. It was the most curious of things\u2014a world with a song all of its own.</p><p>Driven by unknown magic, the music produced by Runeterra was as primitive, unevolved, and chaotic as the mortal beings that lived there\u2026 and yet it had an inherent beauty, like the rolling thunder of a storm, or the melodious knocking of wooden chimes in the wind that precedes it. Bard would have merely appreciated it for what it was, but unfortunately this particular song had gone <i>far</i> beyond a mere counterpoint to the celestial whole, and was becoming destructive. Something had to be done.</p><p>Touching down in the First Lands of Ionia, Bard and his attendant meeps crossed into the material realm. All at once, his ears became like eyes, and he fashioned himself a simple body from the trinkets and fabrics of a traveling shawm-player\u2019s wagon, including a beguiling mask\u2014circular, with three holes in the face.</p><p>He walked the world for an age, confusing and delighting those he encountered along the way, and found the state of things far more complex than he had first imagined. Many objects of wild and unpredictable power seemed to have made their way erroneously into Runeterra, and were disrupting the natural cosmic order of things. Casting his gaze back to the heavens, Bard deduced that some other power within the celestial realm was at work here\u2026 though to what end, he could not guess.</p><p>Regardless, he has taken to the role of caretaker, retrieving anything out of place and returning it to where it can do no further harm. Though this may be only the first step in bringing the universe back in tune, it may also be the only way this world can be saved from what lies beyond it.</p><p>And Bard is not blind to the future. He can see a great conflict approaching\u2014one fought not in any single realm, but in all\u2014and awaits the time when he must finally pick a side.</p>",

Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful meeps, it is impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always serves the greater good\u2026 in his own odd way.",

She hungers for new experiences, memories, and concepts in vast amounts, devouring whole cities and their populations before repurposing the information into a sprawling alien landscape known as the Lavender Sea. Yet even the Void is not safe from her voracity as she spreads within it like a primordial ocean, forcing all before her to submit to her world of want... or be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Though Bel\u2019Veth is new to Runeterra, her birth is untold millennia in the making\u2014the end result of an allergic reaction between the Void and a nascent reality. The once-pristine dimension of peaceful nothingness was irrevocably shattered when existence came into being, and forcefully individualized Void entities lashed out for eons in an attempt to defend themselves from the shock and pain. Erasing everything they consumed, they were named by virtue of what they left behind\u2014a void. But the beings within were changed each time they touched the world, mutating from their once-perfect forms into hedonistic, violent animals.</p>\n<p>So too did the Void change with them. After every battle, every incursion, something more sinister grew deep within a hidden womb inside the darkest recesses of the Voidborn tunnels... Buildings, sunlight, proto-humanoid limbs reaching toward nothing... A jigsaw puzzle where none of the pieces fit... The Void had taken a new, hideous shape. In time, fueled both by humans opening rifts for war and the Watchers attempting to invade the Freljord, this blasphemous pocket of un-creation grew to embrace the opposites of the Old Void: desire, want, and need.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, it craved a leader. Someone\u2014or something\u2014who could write a horrific new chapter in the worlds above and below. A leader who could interface with these \u201chumans,\u201d tell them of what was to come, and harvest their emotions and memories as they fought a bitter, fruitless war until the last fires of civilization died and a new era spawned.</p>\n<p>This leader is Bel\u2019Veth. A terrifying empress born from the combined memories, experiences, and emotions of an entire devoured port city and its outlying ocean\u2014Bel\u2019Veth\u2019s mind contains millions of years of perfectly preserved knowledge, giving her near-omniscience as she prepares to destroy both Runeterra and the domain of her progenitors, the Watchers.</p>\n<p>To those lucky enough to be of strategic value to her, she does not lie, ask questions, nor obfuscate the truth\u2014she simply states the nature of things, for with victory all but assured thanks to the very nature of the Void itself, there is no need to say anything more. And to those who displease her, they will find her human form to be merely adaptational\u2014nerve endings, muscles, and eyestalks\u2014as she unfurls her titanic wings to reveal her true, monstrous figure.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the ancient Shurimans had a word for such a concept. Loosely translated to \u201cGod of Oblivion,\u201d it was a tribal myth of a remorseless deity who would erase all things without hatred, replacing them with itself. They named the city of Belveth after it, though the true meaning was lost after many hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Lost to all, perhaps, save for the creature that city has become.</p>\n",

For all its boundless creativity, there is also waste, destruction, and suffering in the undercity, so pervasive that even the tools created to alleviate it cannot escape its corrosive grasp.</p><p>Designed to remove the toxic waste claiming whole neighborhoods of Zaun, lumbering mechanical golems toiled in violently hazardous locations. One such golem worked alongside its fellows, fulfilling its programming to reclaim Zaun for the people. But the caustic reality of their mission soon wore away at its robust form, and before long it was rendered inoperative and discarded as useless.</p><p>Useless to all but one person. The inventor Viktor discovered the abandoned golem and, seeing the potential still within the inert chassis, inspiration struck. Viktor began a series of experiments, seeking to improve the automaton by introducing a new element that would elevate it far beyond the original scope of its creation.</p><p>Hextech.</p><p>Implanting a priceless hextech crystal sourced from the deserts of Shurima into the chassis of the forsaken golem, Viktor waited with baited breath as the machine rumbled to life.</p><p>Viktor named the golem Blitzcrank after the fizzing arcs of lightning that danced around their frame, an unexpected side effect of the hextech crystal, and sent them down into the most toxic regions of Zaun. Not only did Blitzcrank prove as capable as any of their steam-powered brethren, but they accomplished their tasks with vastly improved speed and efficiency, and as the days turned into weeks, Viktor began to watch something miraculous unfold\u2026</p><p>His creation was <i>learning</i>.</p><p>Blitzcrank innovated, interpreting and extrapolating on their daily directives. As a result, they did far more to serve the people of Zaun, and even began to interact with them on a regular basis. Seeing his golem progress to the cusp of self-awareness, Viktor sought to replicate his achievement, but found only frustration and failure, as the key to Blitzcrank\u2019s blossoming consciousness eluded him.</p><p>Not all of Blitzcrank\u2019s growth was cause for celebration. Concepts like moderation and nuance escaped them, and Blitzcrank would pursue any effort with the entirety of their being, or none at all. They would occasionally overdo or misinterpret the requests of Zaunites, such as smashing down the front of a tenement to admit a single resident who had lost their key.</p><p>Or even tearing an entire factory apart.</p><p>Dispatched by Viktor to clear a neighborhood of toxic chemicals, Blitzcrank traced the caustic runoff to its source. Reasoning that the most efficient means to prevent further pollution was to eliminate the <i>source</i> of said pollution, Blitzcrank proceeded to destroy the factory, their lightning-wreathed fists not stopping until it was reduced to a mound of rubble and twisted iron.</p><p>Enraged, the chem-baron who owned the ruined factory descended upon Viktor, demanding that he destroy the golem or pay a steeper price in blood. Viktor was devastated, having come to view Blitzcrank as a living being rather than simply a tool to do his bidding. He concocted a scheme to smuggle his creation to safety, ready to accept the dangers and consequences of doing so\u2014but as he returned to his laboratory to set his plan in motion, he discovered that Blitzcrank was already gone.</p><p>Blitzcrank\u2019s evolution beyond the constraints of their original programming had yet to cease. Having grown into full self-sufficiency, they resolved to take up their mission independent from their creator. Rumors abound that the golem has even begun to upgrade their own form as they labor tirelessly to assist and protect Zaunites without pausing for instruction.</p><p>They now patrol the undercity, deciding for themselves how best to shepherd Zaun down the path to becoming the greatest city Valoran has ever seen.</p>",

The little magic and herbcraft his mother possessed allowed them both to survive on the fringes of a small coastal community named Rygann\u2019s Reach. Friends were few and far between. Even as a young boy, he knew his father was an enemy reaver, and that he\u2014and Kegan by extension\u2014was the reason his mother was shunned. The villagers called him \u201cthe reaver-bastard\u201d. Kegan allowed his loneliness and resentment to smolder, often turning violent.</p><p>After enduring years of seemingly endless winter, his mother\u2019s frail body finally gave in. As Kegan spread her funeral ashes, he thought of the people she had spent her life healing. None had come to pay their respects. He knew they wished him to disappear into the cold air as well.</p><p>He would oblige them, but not before he took his revenge. He burned down the village and fled into the night, leaving himself with scars that would never heal.</p><p>Kegan wandered the frozen tundra of the Freljord. He told himself that he was searching for his father, but he knew deep down he was looking for a friend... or, at the very least, a kind face. Finding neither, he holed himself up in a cave, and waited to die.</p><p>It was not death that came to him, but another outsider.</p><p>The mysterious mage named Ryze saw potential in this half-frozen young man, and took him on as an apprentice. Teacher and student struggled as Kegan\u2019s nascent, wild magic frustrated them both, and Ryze\u2019s requests for patience and humility often fell on deaf ears.</p><p>Unfortunately, instructing Kegan would always come second to Ryze\u2019s original mission. He had long sought to collect and hide away a power that could be Runeterra\u2019s unmaking\u2014the legendary World Runes. After tracking down one such fragment, Kegan faced the same desperate temptation that had driven so many before him to madness. The Runes were the source of all magic in the world and, against his master\u2019s warnings, he chose to seize that power for himself.</p><p>Ryze was forced to watch in failure as his apprentice was burned away by the raw magic, Kegan\u2019s soul utterly consumed. The creature that was born in that moment was no longer the bitter young man Ryze had rescued from the snows, nor the Freljordian mage he had come to know as his friend.</p><p>Rather, this vengeful being of fire and fury that now walked the mortal realm would eventually become known as Brand.</p><p>Cursing his former master, and every other living thing that would ever come between him and the Runes, Brand lashed out with magical flames, and Ryze barely escaped with his life.</p><p>Over the centuries since that day, Brand has lived an anarchic, wildfire existence, taking and never giving anything back to the world. At times, he blazes across the heavens like a comet. At others, he sinks into the cold earth and slumbers, waiting for the unmistakable scent of magic that will lead him to another World Rune\u2026 and should he find one, there are precious few in Runeterra with the power to stop him.<br></p>",

His soul burned away, his body a vessel of living flame, Brand now roams Valoran in search of other Runes, swearing revenge for wrongs he could not have suffered in a dozen mortal lifetimes.</i></p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Even as a child, Braum was much larger than other Freljordian youngsters, but his mother taught him never to use his size to intimidate or bully. She came from a proud line of herders, and believed true courage lay in using one\u2019s power not to dominate, but to protect those in need.</p><p>When Braum was still a boy, ice giants devastated a neighboring tribe. That tribe had long preyed upon the herds of Braum\u2019s people, but his mother didn\u2019t hesitate to head out across the tundra to help the survivors, bearing furs, foodstuffs, and healing supplies. At first, Braum didn\u2019t understand why she would aid their rivals\u2014but after her actions saved many lives, they became lifelong allies. He finally understood what his mother meant when she said all the Freljord\u2019s people were a family, and from that day forth, he pledged to bring that family together.</p><p>As Braum grew, it was clear he was one of the revered Iceborn, though even among their number, his strength and ability to endure the elements were legendary. He became a local hero, rescuing children who had slipped into icy ravines, saving travelers stranded in blizzards, and protecting families from ravaging wildclaws. Whenever he appeared, people knew help had arrived. He was a figure of hope, known for his liveliness and laughter, and the easy way he made friends.</p><p>Eventually, Braum realized he was needed beyond the valleys and tundra where he\u2019d been raised. Bidding his mother a tearful farewell, he set out to travel the Freljord.</p><p>Over the years, countless stories spread of Braum\u2019s mighty feats and good deeds. While most had at least a kernel of truth, they grew increasingly far-fetched and mythic\u2014such as the legend of how he chopped down an entire forest in a single night using only his bare hands, or how during a volcanic eruption, he saved an isolated farmstead by picking it up and carrying it to higher ground.</p><p>A more recent tale spoke of how Braum found his immense ram-headed shield. As the story went, it was an enchanted vault door, forged in ancient times and set into a mountain. Braum heard cries from within, but he couldn\u2019t break the door down. Undeterred, he punched his way through the mountain\u2019s bare rock, rescuing a troll boy who was trapped inside. He ripped the unbreakable door off its hinges, and has borne it ever since.</p><p>As with many legends about him, Braum laughed uproariously when he first heard this particular tale\u2014but far from refuting such stories, he <i>embraces</i> them. Why let the truth get in the way of inspiring others to acts of generosity and kindness?</p><p>No matter how he actually found his shield, soon afterward Braum made his way to the sacred site of Rakelstake, where many tribes had gathered to hear the words of the Avarosan warmother, Ashe\u2014said to be the reincarnation of Avarosa herself. There, he witnessed the barbarian Tryndamere, desperate to prove his worth, savagely beating any who would face him.</p><p>As Braum watched, he saw that Tryndamere was growing increasingly unhinged. During one duel, he was so lost in his fury that it seemed certain he would kill his opponent, despite having already prevailed. Deciding things had gone far enough, Braum planted himself in front of the downed fighter, shield raised, and Tryndamere hacked and smashed against the impenetrable bulwark. When the barbarian\u2019s rage finally subsided, Braum\u2019s good humor won him over, and before long the pair were laughing and drinking to each other\u2019s health. Some even say that it was Braum who first introduced Tryndamere to Ashe. The barbarian would later marry her, becoming her only bloodsworn.</p><p>Braum doesn\u2019t hold any particular tribal allegiance, for he views all within the Freljord as brothers and sisters. Even so, he sees in Ashe someone who can end the centuries-old feuding among the Freljord\u2019s tribes, and the Avarosans have informally adopted him into their number. Braum\u2019s dream, as he often tells adoring children, is that someday the Freljord will be united in one big family\u2026 and then he can retire to become a humble poro herder.</p><p>Though Braum counts no one as his enemy, he has had a few run-ins with the Frostguard since he started carrying his shield. He doesn\u2019t understand why they have a grudge against him, nor why they seem so interested in what he now bears\u2026</p>",
                "lore_short": "Blessed with massive biceps and an even bigger heart, Braum is a beloved Iceborn hero of the Freljord. Every mead hall north of Frostheld toasts his legendary strength and tells tales of how he felled a forest of oaks in a single night, and punched an entire mountain into rubble. With his shield, an enchanted vault door forged in ages past, Braum roams the frozen north as a cheerful protector, helping the vulnerable as he works toward his dream of a peaceful Freljord.",

When her first mission ended in a frenzied, gory failure, the Black Rose decided that Briar was too dangerous to use, but too powerful to be destroyed. In order to control her, they devised a special pillory\u2014locked by a hemolith gemstone\u2014to restrain her and focus her mind. Once shackled with the pillory, Briar, along with the rest of the Black Rose\u2019s living weapons, was quickly deployed during Jericho Swain\u2019s coup against Darkwill.</p>\n<p>She was given a handler to help direct her, but when released from her pillory, Briar immediately devoured him and everyone near her\u2014everyone <em>but</em> her target, Swain, who escaped while the living weapon fed upon friend and foe.</p>\n<p>After an arduous capture, Swain\u2019s guards managed to trigger Briar\u2019s pillory and restore her restraint, enabling them to transfer her to their holding facility.</p>\n<p>Alone in her cell, Briar could focus on nothing <em>except</em> her hunger.

Did Swain\u2019s forces manage to capture other living weapons during the coup? Was she locked up with them now, each having failed their mission? Their <em>purpose</em>?</p>\n<p>The voices cried out for blood\u2014a sentiment Briar could relate to. But what she couldn\u2019t stand wasn\u2019t how often they did it, nor how loud they were, but that it was ALL they talked about. Their unrelenting hemomania was the most boring thing she had ever experienced.</p>\n<p>As hungry as Briar was\u2014and she was <em>hungry</em>\u2014her thoughts stayed focused on the pitiful sounds of the others. What if she managed to break out of the pillory? Would her frenzy make her even more unhinged than her neighbors? <em>Would she become as single-minded and boring as them?</em> The idea was too horrifying to dwell on, so she instead resigned herself to listless solitude.</p>\n<p>Years passed, and the time alone allowed Briar to reflect on herself and consider the possibilities of the world outside her cell. Entertainment consisted of eavesdropping on the guards\u2019 conversations, devising new ways to pester them for raw meat, and agonizing over whether she should race her pet spiders or eat them.</p>\n<p>By chance while she was toying with her pillory one day, she inadvertently loosened the hemolith, which settled into a position just short of unlocking the restraint. Briar froze as thoughts of her hemomaniacal neighbors filled her head\u2014is that what she\u2019d become? But then she realized something: Being <em>under </em>control was just as dangerous as being <em>out of </em>control. She wanted to strike the balance.</p>\n<p>Having discovered the hemolith\u2019s mechanism, Briar devised a plan.</p>\n<p>By this point, the guards were so used to her calls for attention that when she lured one close to her cell, nobody noticed he was missing until it was too late. The guard\u2019s blood surged within her, lighting a fire that had been waiting to spread.</p>\n<p>Briar was finally free.</p>Now the living weapon gleefully roams the streets of Noxus, pillory locked back in place\u2014until <em>she</em> wants to unlock it.

                "lore_full": "<p>Born into a wealthy and influential merchant clan, Caitlyn Kiramman swiftly learned the social graces of life in Piltover, but preferred to spend her time in the wilder lands outside it. Equally adept at mingling with the moneyed elite of the City of Progress or stalking a deer through the mud of the forest, she could confidently track a bird on the wing over the merchant districts, or put a shot through the eye of a hare at a hundred paces with her father\u2019s repeater musket.</p> <p>Caitlyn\u2019s greatest assets, however, were her intelligence and willingness to learn from her parents, who reinforced her understanding of right and wrong, even within a life of comfort and privilege. Her mother was one of the highest comptrollers in Clan Kiramman, and would always warn Caitlyn of Piltover\u2019s seductions, and its gilded promises that could harden the kindest heart. At first, Caitlyn paid little heed\u2014to her, Piltover was a place of beauty and order that she cherished after each trip into the wild.</p> <p>All that was to change one Progress Day, some years later.</p> <p>Caitlyn returned to find her home ransacked and empty. The family retainers were all dead, and there was no trace of her parents. Caitlyn secured the house, and immediately set out to find them.</p> <p>Tracking within the confines of a city was very different from hunting in the wild but, one by one, Caitlyn located the thugs who had invaded her family home. The trail eventually led her to a hidden safehouse, where her mother and father were being tortured for information. She rescued them under cover of darkness, and alerted the Piltover Wardens\u2026 though not one of the kidnappers they arrested knew the identity of the individual who had hired them\u2014only a proxy with the initial <em>C</em>.</p> <p>Caitlyn and her parents began to rebuild their lives\u2026 but something fundamental had changed. Her mother in particular could no longer face the politics and duplicity of clan life, and gave up her prestigious role, leaving something of a vacuum in the Kiramman leadership. And, though she loved her parents dearly, Caitlyn had no desire to take her mother\u2019s place, nor to learn her father\u2019s trade as an artificer.</p> <p>Instead, her focus turned toward breaking through the web of intrigue surrounding the mysterious \"C\". Utilizing her hunting skills, she established herself as a private investigator, and quickly made a name for herself as someone who could find anything or anyone. In recognition of her self-made success, Caitlyn\u2019s parents crafted her a hextech rifle of exquisite artifice, with greater accuracy than any musket. The weapon could take a variety of specialized shells, and be easily modified in the field.</p> <p>After a particularly traumatic case involving a missing hextech device and a series of child abductions, Caitlyn was summoned by the Wardens.</p> <p>She had been recommended by one of their number who had also developed something of an affinity for stranger cases\u2014and their battle with a host of rogue chimerics in the employ of a lunatic chem-researcher driven mad by his own concoctions led to her being offered a formal position as a sheriff. At first, Caitlyn refused, but eventually came to realize that the Wardens\u2019 resources could potentially get her closer to discovering the true identity of \u201cC\".</p> <p>Caitlyn has since become a highly respected officer within the ranks of the Wardens, always striving to make the City of Progress a better and safer place. She recently partnered with a new recruit from Zaun, the brash and reckless Vi. How such an unlikely pairing came about\u2014and been proven so effective\u2014is the subject of wild rumor and tavern speculation among their fellow Wardens, as well as those they haul away to jail.</p> <p>What Caitlyn doesn't know, however, is that \"C\" is also keeping tabs on her... especially as her investigations bring her ever closer to the truth.</p>",

Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn\u2019s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Clan Ferros understands sacrifice.</p><p>Most of the family\u2019s wealth came through harvesting a rare crystal from the brackern, a creature native to Shurima. These hex-crystals\u2014or \u201cfirst crystals\u201d\u2014contained power normally only wielded by those born with innate magical ability. After Camille\u2019s great-great aunt lost an arm during an early expedition, her sacrifice inspired the Ferros family motto: <i>\u201cFor family, will I give.\u201d</i></p><p>The brackern were a limited resource, and Camille's family had to augment the crystals they\u2019d accumulated. Utilizing shadow investments in chemtech and runic alchemy, they developed less powerful, but easier to make, synthetic hex-crystals.</p><p>Yet there were consequences\u2014synthetic crystal manufacturing has long been rumored to heavily contribute to the Zaun Gray. Furthermore, it was only through espionage, intimidation, and murder that Clan Ferros held its monopoly on this priceless commodity, and ensured its uninterrupted production in Zaun, maintaining the family\u2019s place in Piltover\u2019s illustrious Bluewind Court.</p><p>As the eldest surviving child of Clan Ferros\u2019 masters, Camille received every educational advantage. She had exceptional tutors, learning to speak several foreign languages and play the cellovinna at a concert-master level. Camille also learned to read and write Ancient Shuriman while assisting her father on digs in the Odyn Valley.</p><p>Traditionally, one of the younger children would become their family's principal intelligencer, working with the clan master to secure their family\u2019s success by any means necessary. However, Camille's younger brother, Stevan, had a weak constitution, and so Camille took his place. He jealously watched her embrace her additional training, and she became quite adept in combat, reconnaissance, and interrogation.</p><p>When Camille was twenty-five, augmented Zaunite thugs attacked her and her father, intent on stealing lucrative trade secrets. Camille\u2019s father succumbed to his wounds, and in anguish, her mother died soon after. Stevan became clan master, and he doubled the clan\u2019s research in human hextech augmentation, eager to prove himself as a strong leader.</p><p>After a year of mourning, Stevan oversaw the induction of Hakim Naderi\u2014a promising young crystallographer from the Shuriman coastal city of Bel'zhun\u2014as the family\u2019s lead artificer.</p><p>Camille requested hextech augmentation from Hakim to push her beyond her human limitations. Hakim was instantly enamored with her, and they bonded over the preparations and late night stories of Shurima\u2026 and eventually, Camille returned Hakim's feelings. Their affair grew reckless, as they knew the surgery would conclude their time together. Hakim would move onto other projects, and Camille would once again be fully committed to the principal intelligencer\u2019s duties. More than that, Hakim worried that in carving away Camille's heart, he might remove her humanity.</p><p>Days before Camille's operation, Hakim proposed marriage and begged her to run away with him. For the first time in her life, Camille was torn.</p><p>Stevan had no such conflict, as he needed Camille to execute his vision. When he learned of the secret proposal, he devised a plan\u2014the next time Camille and Hakim were together, Stevan set himself up to be attacked. When she saw her brother bruised and bloodied, Camille recognized what could happen when her attention was divided.</p><p>Hakim pleaded with Camille, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. For family, she would give. She ended her relationship with Hakim, insisting her surgery go forward.</p><p>He was the only one who could safely perform the operation, and so he excised Camille\u2019s heart and replaced it with hextech\u2014then resigned. When she awoke, the lab she and Hakim had shared was abandoned.</p><p>Camille focused on her work. She took on further refinements, including bladed legs, grapple-spindled hips, and other, minor hex-augmentations, leading some to wonder how much of the woman was left. And as Clan Ferros amassed more power and wealth, Camille\u2019s missions became darker and more deadly.</p><p>Thanks to her hextech heart, she did not age\u2014but the years were not so kind to her brother. Yet even as Stevan's body grew more frail, his iron grip on the clan remained.</p><p>Eventually, Camille uncovered the depth of Stevan's betrayal, and realized his machinations were no longer in the family\u2019s best interests. In that moment, she discarded the last sentiment she felt toward her brother.</p><p>After installing her favorite grand-niece as clan master, Camille now runs the family's public affairs as well as its more shady operations. As a solver of\u2026 <i>difficult problems</i>, she embraces her more-than-human transformation and the cutting judgment it affords her\u2014but a strange, mournful keening in her hextech heart may yet prove a troubling portent.</p><p>Regardless, Camille refuses to sit idle, and gains invigoration from well-executed industrial espionage, a fresh-brewed cup of tea, and long walks in the Gray.</p>",

With a mind as sharp as the blades she bears, Camille's pursuit of superiority through hextech body augmentation has left many to wonder if she is now more machine than human.",

From an early age, she displayed a keen mind and sharp wit, and while her sister Katarina flourished under their father\u2019s tutelage, it was their mother Soreana in whose footsteps Cassiopeia would follow.</p><p>A hero of Noxus\u2019 expansion into Shurima, General Du Couteau eventually sent for his family, installing them close to the governor of the coastal city of Urzeris. Surrounded by strangers in an unfamiliar land, Cassiopeia remained close to her mother, learning much of politics, diplomacy, and subtle influence. As she grew, Cassiopeia could not help but glimpse other, hidden concerns within Soreana, beyond those of the empire\u2026</p><p>One day, quite unexpectedly, Soreana collapsed in the family residence\u2014her hairbrush had been laced with caustic venoms by an unknown hand, leaving her close to death. General du Couteau was well versed in the ways of an assassin, and so he had all the household staff removed, leaving his wife and daughters alone in an empty house.</p><p>Still little more than a child, Cassiopeia never left her mother\u2019s bedside. While Soreana\u2019s recovery took many months, the bond between them became stronger than ever before.</p><p>When the general was recalled to Noxus to prepare for the long-awaited invasion of Ionia, he took Katarina with him, but Cassiopeia remained in Urzeris. Seemingly relieved, Soreana confided in her daughter that she belonged to a clandestine and secretive cabal, known by some as \u201cthe Black Rose\u201d. Having guided the empire for centuries, they had finally managed to spread their influence into Shurima.</p><p>Now free of her husband\u2019s watchful eye, Soreana\u2019s real work could begin.</p><p>In time, and under her mother\u2019s tutelage, Cassiopeia blossomed into a young woman of tremendous beauty, cunning and intelligence, if somewhat lacking in empathy. She saw those around her as tools to be used to achieve her goals, and then cast aside just as quickly.</p><p>Though she had barely reached the cusp of womanhood, she was initiated into the Black Rose by hunting down and eliminating those who had sought the death of her mother. She surprised even Soreana with her speed and efficiency, and left no trace of her activities\u2014or her proxies\u2014behind. Only then was Cassiopeia made privy to the cabal\u2019s broader plan for Shurima. Using her family\u2019s tremendous resources, she undertook a number of expeditions into the deep desert, raiding ancient ruins with the help of a local mercenary named Sivir.</p><p>Her efforts were made all the more urgent when word reached Urzeris from the capital. Grand General Boram Darkwill had been deposed by Jericho Swain, and a number of noble houses had chosen to honor this coup\u2026 including Du Couteau.</p><p>Outraged and disgusted by her husband\u2019s betrayal, and fearing that all members of the Black Rose were now in jeopardy, Soreana became desperate. She dispatched Cassiopeia to seek out the godlike power that had been the key to Shurima\u2019s supremacy in ages past. Cassiopeia swore she would return with a weapon ready for the looming secret war, or not at all.</p><p>Fulfilling this oath would leave her changed forever. Upon unearthing a long lost tomb of the mythical Ascended, she knew this was the threshold to the power she sought, and intended to dispatch all witnesses from her expedition before claiming it. The guide Sivir was the first to fall to Cassiopeia\u2019s blade, but then an ancient stone tomb guardian reared up, and buried its fangs into her flesh.</p><p>Overcome by its arcane toxins, she was carried back through the desert by her hired soldiers, screaming as her body twisted into something new and unspeakable\u2026</p><p>Cassiopeia locked herself in the disused crypt of the Urzeris residence, and endured the untold agonies of this transformation. Gone was the brilliant and beautiful daughter of Soreana Du Couteau, replaced by a monstrous, slithering creature that skulked in the shadows, spitting poison, and crushing stone as easily as glass.</p><p>For weeks she wept and howled, grieving her lost life\u2026 until the day she could weep no more. She dragged herself up from the depths of despair, determined to accept\u2014maybe even someday <i>embrace?</i>\u2014her fate. It was not the Ascension she had hoped for, but Cassiopeia had unearthed the magic of dead Shuriman gods. She would turn it to the schemes of the Black Rose just as she and her mother had planned, and she could feel this power growing within her, day by day.</p><p>Though into what, even she cannot guess.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Cassiopeia is a deadly creature bent on manipulating others to her will. Youngest and most beautiful daughter of the noble Du Couteau family of Noxus, she ventured deep into the crypts beneath Shurima in search of ancient power. There, she was bitten by a gruesome tomb guardian, whose venom transformed her into a viper-like predator. Cunning and agile, Cassiopeia now slithers under the veil of night, petrifying her enemies with her baleful gaze.",

What yordles lack in stature, they make up for with industriousness. Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force (BCEF). Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki soars over Valoran, surveying the landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics for the benefit of onlookers below.</p><p>Corki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of madness. He served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions that would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good dogfight in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased, Corki was forced into a retirement, which he felt &apos;&apos;cut the engines and clipped the wings.&#x2019;&#x2019; He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him.</p>",

After leaving Bandle City, he settled in Piltover and fell in love with the wondrous machines he found there. He dedicated himself to the development of flying contraptions, leading an aerial defense force of seasoned veterans known as the Screaming Yipsnakes. Calm under fire, Corki patrols the skies around his adopted home, and has never encountered a problem that a good missile barrage couldn\u2019t solve.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Darius and his brother Draven grew up as orphans in the port city of Basilich. Darius struggled to provide for them both, constantly fighting with gangs of older urchins and anyone else who threatened his little brother\u2014even the city guard. Every day on the streets was a battle for survival, and Darius earned more scars by his twelfth summer than some soldiers do in a lifetime.</p><p>After Basilich was seized by the expanding Noxian empire, the victorious commander Cyrus saw the strength in these defiant brothers, and they found a home within the ranks of his warhost. Over the years, they fought in many grueling campaigns of conquest from one end of the known world to the other, as well as crushing a number of rebellions against the throne.</p><p>Within the empire, anyone could rise to power, no matter their birth, culture, or background, and none embraced this ideal more fervently than Darius. From humble beginnings, he rose steadily through the ranks, always putting duty before all else, and garnering great respect for his aggression, discipline, and refusal to ever take a backward step. On the bloodsoaked fields of Dalamor Plain, he even beheaded a Noxian general after the coward ordered a retreat. Roaring in defiance and hefting his bloodied axe overhead, Darius rallied the scattered warbands and won a great and unexpected victory against a far more numerous foe.</p><p>He was rewarded with a senior command of his own, attracting many thousands of eager recruits from across the empire. Darius turned the majority away, accepting only the strongest, the most disciplined and iron-willed. Such was his fearsome notoriety, even in the lands beyond Noxus, that it was not uncommon for entire cities to surrender at the first sight of his banners.</p><p>After a grinding victory against the cloud-fortresses of the Varju, a proud warrior people who had resisted decades of Noxian aggression, Darius was named the Hand of Noxus by Emperor Boram Darkwill himself. Those who knew Darius best knew he craved neither power nor adulation\u2014he wished merely to see Noxus triumph over all\u2014so Darkwill ordered him and his warhosts far north into the Freljord, to finally bring the barbarian tribes to heel.</p><p>The campaign dragged on for years, ending in a bitter, icy stalemate. Darius narrowly survived assassination attempts, ambushes, and even capture by the vicious Winter\u2019s Claw. He was growing weary of endless wars of attrition, and returned to Noxus to demand a reconsolidation of the military.</p><p>He marched his veterans into the capital, only to find that the emperor was dead, killed in a coup led by Jericho Swain. The act had been supported by many allies, including Darius\u2019s own brother, Draven.</p><p>This was a difficult position. As Hand, many of the noble houses would expect Darius to avenge Darkwill, but he had known and greatly respected the disgraced general Swain, and had spoken against his discharge after the botched offensive in Ionia some years earlier. The oaths of the Hand were to Noxus, not any particular ruler, and Swain was a man who spoke honestly of his new vision for the empire. Darius realized this was a leader he was prepared to follow... but Swain had other ideas.</p><p>With the establishment of the Trifarix, three individuals would rule Noxus together, each embodying one principle of strength: Vision, Might, and Guile. Darius gladly accepted his place on this council, and pledged to raise a new, elite force\u2014the Trifarian Legion, the most loyal and prestigious warriors the empire could produce\u2014and lead the armies of Noxus into a glorious new age of conquest.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Diana did not belong on Mount Targon. A group of Solari hunters discovered her swaddled between her frost-claimed parents\u2014strangers to this land, who had clearly traveled a long way. The hunters brought her to their temple, dedicated her, and raised her as a member of the Tribes of the Last Sun, known to many as the Rakkor.</p><p>Like all of the Solari faith, she underwent rigorous physical and religious training. However, unlike others, Diana was determined to understand <i>why</i> the Solari act the way they do, and the reasoning behind their beliefs. She spent her evenings digging through the libraries, devouring texts with only pale moonlight to read by. Paradoxically, this pursuit provided more questions than answers, and her teachers\u2019 aphoristic replies did little to sate her inquisitive mind.</p><p>When Diana began to notice tomes had whole chapters torn from them, and all references to the moon seemed missing, the teachers assigned harsh punishments, intending to exhaust her into devotion. Likewise, her fellow acolytes distanced themselves from her and her questioning.</p><p>There was one shining beacon in these years of confused, frustrated isolation: Leona. The most devout of Diana\u2019s peers, they often found themselves in impassioned debate. Though one never swayed the other in their long and frequent conversations, they developed a close friendship.</p><p>Then, one glorious night, Diana discovered a hidden alcove deep within the mountain. Moonlight spilled against its walls, revealing imagery of the sun, of soldiers armored in gold alongside silver-clad warriors, and matching imagery of the moon, atop Targon\u2019s greatest peek. Delighted, Diana raced to share this clear message with Leona\u2014the sun and moon were not enemies after all!</p><p>Leona did not react with joy.</p><p>She urged Diana to put this heresy from her mind entirely, warning of the punishments that may befall her if she were to voice such thoughts to others. Diana had never seen her serious friend quite <i>so</i> grave.</p><p>Frustration gnawed at her. She had reached the end of the Solari\u2019s knowledge, yet not even Leona would take this new discovery into account. What were the Solari hiding? Increasingly, Diana felt certain there was only one place she could go for answers: the top of Mount Targon.</p><p>The climb tested her in every way imaginable, and time seemed to stand still as she scaled the peak. To survive, she focused her thoughts on her lone companion, and the answers that would make the Solari better, more <i>whole</i>.</p><p>The summit greeted her with the brightest, fullest moon she\u2019d ever seen. After a rapturous moment, a pillar of moonlight slammed into her and she felt a presence taking hold of her, sharing glimpses of the past, and of another Rakkor faith called the Lunari. Diana realized this presence could only be one of the legendary Aspects\u2026 and she had been chosen as its host.</p><p>When the light dissipated, her mind was again her own. Diana found herself clad in armor, holding a crescent blade, and hair once dark hair now gleaming silver. She turned to find she was not alone\u2014Leona stood at her side, similarly bedecked in shining, golden battleplate, a sunbreak-bright shield and sword in her hands.</p><p>Diana was overjoyed to share in this revelatory moment with her friend, but Leona thought only of returning to the Solari. Diana begged her not to, desperate that they face this new future <i>together</i>. But Leona refused, and their disagreement quickly turned into a titanic battle, erupting with moonlight and sunfire.</p><p>Fearful of losing herself to the Aspect\u2019s power, Diana ultimately fled down the mountain. But, vindicated in her search, she felt more certain than ever that she had been right to question the Solari\u2019s teachings. It was time to confront them, and show the error of their ways.</p><p>Pushing past their Ra\u2019Horak guardians, Diana burst into the chambers of the high priests. They listened with mounting horror as she told of what she had learned of the Lunari\u2026 and then they denounced her as a heretic, a blasphemer, and a peddler of false gods. Rage filled Diana, amplified by the Aspect within, and she embraced it in a terrible burst of moonlight. Startled, she fled the temple, leaving a trail of death in her wake.</p><p>Now, driven by half-remembered visions and glimpses of ancient knowledge, Diana clings to the only truths she knows for certain\u2014that the Lunari and the Solari need not be foes, and that there is a greater purpose for her than to be a Solari acolyte of Mount Targon.</p><p>And though that destiny remains unclear, Diana will seek it out, whatever the cost.</p>",

For this man is no doctor at all, except in the fancy of his own mind.</p><p>Though his true name has been lost to both time and memory, Dr. Mundo was once an enforcer for one of Zaun's most powerful chem-barons. Known for his boisterous affability, he was remarkably good-natured for a man who made his living off physical intimidation. He was always quick with a familiar nickname and a friendly clap on the back, and often blissfully unaware of the toes he was stepping on. It wasn\u2019t long before he had stepped firmly on the toes of his boss.</p><p>Determined to make an example of his underling, the chem-baron had him committed to Osweld Asylum\u2014a place well known for its inhumane treatment and questionable cures. The baron watched with satisfaction as his enforcer was placed in restraints and dragged away to the padded confines of the asylum\u2019s most secure cell.</p><p>As months went by, the enforcer suffered unspeakable horrors at the hands of his supposed caregivers. Experimental treatments were rendered without concern for the patient's well-being. Nerves were prodded, lobes were severed, and unproved medicines were administered in large quantities. The enforcer began to change, his large frame gaining more muscle by the day. His brain, however, suffered a far worse fate. As he lost all memory of his past life, the enforcer struggled to make sense of the cruel world around him. He looked down at his old restraining jacket\u2014it almost resembled the white coats of the medical professionals that surrounded him.</p><p>Misreading the words on his own uniform, he began to assume a new name and new profession for himself.</p><p><i>I must be a doctor, too. Why else would I be in this wretched asylum?</i> he reasoned. <i>And all these other people... must be my patients.</i></p><p>At last, the day came when the chem-baron arrived to discharge his enforcer from the asylum. To his surprise, there was no one to greet him in the lobby. The halls were empty and dead silent, save for the faint, incoherent babbling of a deranged patient in a room at the end of the hallway.</p><p>The baron entered the room to a horrifying sight: Scattered across the floor were countless bodies\u2014staff and patients alike, dismembered beyond recognition. Standing above them, a hulking, purple monstrosity blathered unintelligibly as a large blue tongue lolled out the side of its gaping mouth. Muscles bulged grotesquely beneath its undersized garments, and its fist tightened around the handle of a surgical saw. The baron turned pale as his gaze found the face of the monster\u2014and recognized it as his old enforcer.</p><p>The enforcer, who recalled nothing of his old boss, saw only another patient in desperate need of treatment. The purple thing lumbered toward the chem-baron, wagging his bonesaw in anticipation. The baron drew his chem-tech pistol and fired. The shot tore through the looming mass in front of him, staggering the monster...</p><p>But only for a brief moment.</p><p>The hole in the creature's flesh quickly closed as new slabs of muscle rapidly regrew over the wound. The monster paused, eyed the baron quizzically, and uttered, \u201cYou sick. Need help!\u201d</p><p>Mimicking what he had seen performed countless times by the asylum's former practitioners, the enforcer threw the man on a nearby gurney, strapped his arms into the restraints, and prepared his instruments for surgery. The chem-baron turned pale as he realized the grim fate that awaited him.</p><p>The ensuing surgery\u2014like so many before and after it\u2014was <i>not</i> successful. The burgeoning doctor added the remains of his latest patient to the pile on the floor. Though he was saddened he could not save them, he knew he had done all he could. Besides, he would have other chances. Zaun was full of sick people just waiting to be cured. With a smile returning to his face, he left the hospital and set out into the streets to find more patients.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Even as an orphan on the streets of Basilich, Draven was headstrong and full of bravado, frequently getting into vicious brawls with older street children and shady underworld thugs. While supremely confident in his own ability\u2014some would say <i>overconfident</i>\u2014it is unlikely he would have survived childhood had it not been for his older brother, Darius, who invariably finished the fights Draven started.</p><p>When Basilich fell to the warhosts of Noxus, the brothers came to the attention of a captain named Cyrus, after Draven made an ill-considered attempt on his life. Impressed with their fighting spirit, Cyrus allowed them to join the Noxian ranks.</p><p>For years, the brothers fought as part of Cyrus\u2019 warhost\u2014yet while Darius took to this life easily, Draven grew steadily more bored. His martial skill was beyond question, but the daily drudgery of soldiering felt like too much effort for too little reward\u2026 and not enough personal glory.</p><p>Darius inevitably rose to command his own warband, and Draven joined him. However, if he thought that would be easier, or a way to achieve greater individual recognition, he was sorely disappointed.</p><p>Some say Draven chose to leave Darius\u2019 command. Some say he was forced out. Either way, his skills were highly sought after as a champion and duelist, and he was enticed to join a succession of warbands during the occupation of Ionia, before ending up with a fairly respectable contract in the Reckoning pits.</p><p>For centuries, the gladiatorial Reckoners had performed a vital role in Noxus\u2014punishing criminals and settling disputes between the noble houses\u2014and Draven was determined to receive the riches, adoration, and renown he felt he deserved. However, with long, protracted wars on many fronts, the spectacle was beginning to lose its appeal for the common citizen. As the attention of the crowds drifted, Draven fell into a slump, spending more and more time in the seedier drinking halls and gambling dens of the capital.</p><p>He was washed-up and broke when the former general Jericho Swain found him.</p><p>Swain had a plan to reclaim Noxus\u2019 lost glory, and needed Draven\u2019s help to achieve it. Perhaps Swain only enlisted him as a way to ensure his brother Darius\u2019 support after the fact. Regardless, Draven proved integral to Swain\u2019s plan\u2014to depose the Grand General himself, Boram Darkwill.</p><p>Standing triumphant with Swain, Draven smiled for the first time in months as the cheers of the Noxian people washed over him.</p><p>But duty called. In the days and weeks following this unprecedented coup, many among the noble elite refused to honor Swain\u2019s succession, so they were sentenced to death in the arena.</p><p>One condemned man escaped his handlers ahead of his execution. Operating on pure instinct\u2014as was ever his wont\u2014Draven leapt from the high balcony and hurled a pair of axes at the fleeing man, cutting him down in a heartbeat. After a moment of stunned silence, the crowd roared their approval. Draven retrieved his axes, spinning them high in the air, playing to his new fans, and savoring their rapturous applause.</p><p>Thus Draven became the Glorious Executioner, turning routine bouts into grand spectacles that drew ever larger crowds.</p><p>Soon enough, an enterprising (and diminutive) promoter, tired of paying to house, feed, and train Reckoners only for them to die in front of dwindling audiences, approached Draven with an idea. What if the drama of the classic pit fights could be combined with Draven\u2019s natural showmanship?</p><p>The Reckoners quickly became entertainers as much as combatants, each with their own carefully constructed backstory, fighting style, and flamboyant personality. The fights were often bloody\u2014this was still <i>Noxus</i> after all\u2014but far less often ended in death. The rivalries, trash-talking, and intrigue between the best-known Reckoners became the stuff of legend throughout the empire, but none were talked about more than Draven.</p><p>For a time he lived the high life, receiving invitations to a never-ending stream of parties and banquets, mixing with the wealthy and influential of Swain\u2019s new Noxus. He even reconciled with Darius, and would occasionally still march out with the warhosts, defeating enemy champions and generals in single combat.</p><p>Nevertheless, Draven has started to grow restless once again. He has all that he could have ever imagined, and more, but now dreams of the day when the whole <i>world</i> knows his name.</p>",

Addicted to the spectacle of his own brash perfection, Draven has sworn to defeat whomever he must to ensure that his name is chanted throughout the empire forever more.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Born with genius-level intellect, Ekko constructed simple machines before he could crawl. His parents, Inna and Wyeth, vowed to provide a good future for their son\u2014Zaun, with all its pollution and crime, would only stifle Ekko, whom they felt deserved the wealth and opportunities of Piltover. Throughout his youth he watched his parents age beyond their years, toiling for too many hours under dangerous conditions in suffocating factories. They earned meager wages while greedy factory owners, and sneering Piltovan buyers, profited immensely from their labor.</p>\n<p>It would all be worth it, they reasoned, if it meant their son could one day rise to the city above.</p>\n<p>Ekko saw things differently. Beyond Zaun\u2019s flaws, he saw a dynamic place overflowing with energy and potential. Zaunites\u2019 industry, resourcefulness, and resilience stirred a hotbed of pure innovation. They had built a thriving culture from catastrophe, and flourished where others would have perished. That spirit captivated Ekko, and spurred him to a youth of wild invention and innovation.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t alone. He befriended scrappy orphans, inquisitive runaways, and eager upstarts. Zaunites tended to eschew formal education in favor of apprenticeships, but these \u201cLost Children of Zaun\u201d looked to the labyrinthine streets to be their mentor. They wasted time in glorious, youthful fashion\u2014foot races through the border markets, or daring climbs from the Sump to the Promenade. They ran wild and free, answering to no one.</p>\n<p>One night, on a solo trek into the rubble of a recently demolished laboratory, Ekko made an astonishing find: a shard of blue-green crystal that glittered with magical energy. Every child of Zaun heard tales of <em>hextech</em>, said to power weapons and heroes alike. Such a thing had the potential to change the world, and now he held a broken one. He scrambled to find more pieces, but the crunching footfalls of teched-up enforcers told him he wasn\u2019t the only one looking. Ekko barely escaped, and returned to his home.</p>\n<p>He experimented madly with the crystal. During one less-than-scientific attempt, the gem exploded into a vortex of shimmering dust, triggering eddies of temporal distortion. Ekko opened his eyes to see several splintered realities\u2014and several \u201cecho\u201d versions of himself\u2014staring back in sheer panic amid the fractured continua.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d really done it this time.</p>\n<p>After some tense coordination between Ekko and his paradoxes, they managed to contain and repair the hole he had torn in the fabric of reality. Eventually, he harnessed the shattered crystal\u2019s temporal powers into a device that would allow him to manipulate small increments of time\u2026 at least in theory.</p>\n<p>On his name day, his friends badgered him into climbing the ancient clocktower known as Old Hungry, so Ekko brought the untested device along with him.</p>\n<p>The Lost Children climbed, stopping occasionally to paint an obscene caricature or two of prominent Pilties. They were near the top when a handhold gave way, sending one of Ekko\u2019s friends tumbling to certain doom. Instinctively\u2014as if he\u2019d done it a thousand times before\u2014Ekko activated his device. The world shattered around him, and he was wrenched backward through swirling particles of time.</p>\n<p>Then Ekko was back, watching his friend reach again for the same rotting plank. The plank broke, the boy fell\u2026 but Ekko was ready this time, diving to the edge and grabbing him by the shirt. Ekko tried to swing him to safety, but his friend became caught in the tower\u2019s clockwork gears, and\u2014</p>\n<p>Stop. Rewind.</p>\n<p>Several attempts later, Ekko finally saved his friend\u2019s life. But to his crew, Ekko\u2019s supernatural reflexes had saved their friend before anyone even realized the danger. He told them about the crystal and made them swear to secrecy. Instead, they dared each other to new heights of foolishness, knowing Ekko had the means to pluck them out of danger.</p>\n<p>With each trial, and <em>so much</em> error, the time-warping device\u2014which Ekko dubbed the Zero Drive\u2014grew more and more stable. The only limit was how many do-overs his body could take before exhaustion set in.</p>\n<p>Ekko\u2019s time-bending antics have made him a person of interest to some of Zaun and Piltover\u2019s most inventive, most powerful, and most dangerous individuals. But his only interest is in his friends, his family, and his city. He dreams of the day when his hometown rises up to dwarf the so-called City of Progress, when Piltover\u2019s golden veneer will be overshadowed by the towering ingenuity and relentless spunk of a Zaun born not from generations of privilege, but from sheer daring. He may not have a plan yet, but he\u2019s got all the time in the world.</p>\n<p>After all, if Ekko\u2019s Z-Drive can change the past, how hard can it be to change the future?</p>",

Their union was opposed by many, since it would strengthen Kythera at Zaavan\u2019s expense\u2014but Elise worked hard to beguile her intended husband, and manipulated her detractors to secure a betrothal.</p><p>Unbeknown to her, this political marriage had been planned for many years by shadowy forces working behind the scenes throughout the empire, with Berholdt Zaavan a mere pawn in a much larger game. Even so, it was an unexpected twist that Elise should dominate him so completely, and while he remained the face of his house, it was clear who was in charge. As time passed, his resentment grew.</p><p>One evening, over a typically frosty dinner, Berholdt revealed he had poisoned her wine, and demanded Elise withdraw from society and allow him to take up the reins of power. Knowing he would have the antidote about his person, Elise played the role of a remorseful wife, weeping and begging her husband\u2019s forgiveness. Just as it seemed he might be convinced, she snatched up a knife and plunged it into his heart.</p><p>Even with the antidote, Elise was bedridden for weeks\u2026 and it was then that the Pale Woman approached her.</p><p>The enigmatic mistress of \u201cthe Black Rose\u201d spoke of a secret society where hidden knowledge and sorcery were shared among those who could be trusted, and kept from those who could not. In truth, the Pale Woman did not care who controlled each of the noble houses, as long as they were sworn to her. Since Elise had killed the thrall Berholdt, she would have to prove her own value, or a more suitable replacement would be found.</p><p>Seeing a path to greater power, Elise took to the cabal like few before her. She met often with the most prominent members, trading influence and thwarting her rivals in a complex web of tangled schemes. With the wealth of two houses, there were not many who could oppose her, and she became even more adept at <i>persuading</i> others to do her bidding.</p><p>Eventually, she learned of an object that held great significance for the Black Rose\u2014the skull of an ancient warlord known as Sahn-Uzal, rumored to have been hidden long ago in the Shadow Isles. Keen to gain the Pale Woman\u2019s favor, Elise found a desperate, debt-ridden captain willing to bear her and a handful of devotees to the cursed city of Helia. They came ashore on a beach of ashen sand, and were tormented by spiteful wraiths as they searched in vain for the lost vault.</p><p>But Elise found something she had not anticipated.</p><p>A creature of the long-forgotten past had made its home in the lightless depths beneath the city. This bloated, chitinous monster was the spider-god Vilemaw, and it erupted from the darkness to devour the intruders, before sinking its fangs into Elise\u2019s shoulder. She fell, howling and convulsing as the venom wrought terrible changes upon her body. Her spine rippled with undulant motion, and arachnoid legs pushed out from her flesh.</p><p>Finally, breathless with the agony of transformation, Elise turned to find her new master looming above her. An unspoken understanding passed between them in that moment, and she scuttled back to the beach, untroubled by the Isles\u2019 spirits as she weaved in and out of the twisted treeline.</p><p>Some weeks later, when her ship arrived back at the Noxian capital in the dead of night, Elise had regained her human form\u2026 though she was the only living thing left aboard.</p><p>Though no evidence was ever found of the warlord\u2019s skull, the Pale Woman saw Elise\u2019s dangerous new gift for what it was\u2014a means to come and go safely between Noxus and the Shadow Isles. An accord was struck, wherein the Black Rose would provide Elise with endless unwitting sacrifices to offer up to the spider-god, and in return she would recover any artifacts of power she could from those benighted, forbidding shores.</p><p>Elise once again took up residence in the neglected halls of House Zaavan, carefully cultivating a reputation as a seductive yet unreachable recluse.

She began eons ago, as something primordial, shapeless, and barely sentient. This nascent wisp of shadow existed, numb and unroused by any stimulation, for centuries. It might have remained so, had the world not been upended by conflict. The Rune Wars, as they would come to be known, brought an era of mass suffering the world had never known.</p><p>As people across Runeterra began to experience a vast array of pain, anguish, and loss, the shadow stirred. The nothingness it had known for so long had been replaced by the manic vibrations of an agonized world. The creature quivered with excitement.</p><p>As the Rune Wars escalated, the world\u2019s torment grew so intense that the shadow felt as if it might burst. It drank in all of Runeterra\u2019s pain, which it experienced as boundless pleasure. The sensation nourished the creature, and over time, it transformed into something more. It became a demon, a ravenous spiritual parasite that fed on the basest of human emotions.</p><p>When the wars finally ended, the world\u2019s suffering waned, and the demon found itself growing desperate. The only pleasure it had ever known was born of other creatures\u2019 misery. Without their pain, it felt nothing, just as it had in its earliest days.</p><p>If the world would not provide the suffering the demon needed to thrive, it would have to make its own. It needed to inflict pain on other beings so that it could experience that elation again.</p><p>At first, catching prey was a challenge for the demon. It could move undetected in its shadow form, but to touch a human, the creature needed to manifest as something tangible. It made several attempts to fashion a physical body from its shadow-flesh, but each result was more monstrous than the last, scaring off her prey.</p><p>The demon realized it needed a shape that was pleasing to humans, one that would not only lure them right into its claws, but would offer them ecstasy born of their own desires, so that their pain would be that much sweeter.</p><p>From the shadows, it began to study those it sought to prey upon. It tailored its flesh to their liking, learned to say what they wanted to hear, and to walk in a manner they found alluring.</p><p>In a matter of weeks, the demon had perfected her physique, leading dozens of enamored victims to be tortured to death at her hands. Though she relishes the exquisite pain of each of her victims, she always finds herself wanting more. Each human\u2019s desires are so small, and they always expire too soon. Their pain, too fleeting to give her anything more than tiny morsels of pleasure, is just enough to tide her over to the next feeding.</p><p>She yearns for the day she can plunge the world into utter chaos, and she can return to an existence of pure, rapturous ecstasy.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Born and raised in a wealthy neighborhood of Piltover, Ezreal was always a curious child. His parents were renowned archaeologists, so he became used to their long absences from the family home, often fantasizing about joining them on their travels. He loved hearing tales of high adventure, and shared their desire to fill in the blank spaces on every map.</p><p>He was often left in the care of his uncle, the esteemed Professor Lymere. The professor did not enjoy having to wrangle such a rash and unruly child, and assigned the strictest tutors to teach him subjects including advanced cartography, hextech mechanics, and the ancient histories of Runeterra. But the boy had a knack for simply <i>absorbing</i> information, and found studying a waste of time. He passed assessments easily, with little or no preparation, infuriating his uncle and giving himself more time to roam the university grounds. Ezreal took great pleasure in evading the campus wardens, navigating the tunnels beneath the lecture halls as easily as the library rooftops. He even practiced lockpicking, sneaking into his teachers\u2019 offices and rearranging their belongings for his own amusement.</p><p>Whenever Ezreal\u2019s parents returned to Piltover, his father in particular would tell him all they had seen, and their plans for future expeditions\u2014none more ambitious and secretive than the search for the lost tomb of Ne\u2019Zuk, a Shuriman tyrant who was said to be able to jump instantly from one place to another. If Ezreal\u2019s father could learn whatever sorcery Ne\u2019Zuk had possessed, he joked that wherever he was traveling, he would simply drop into Piltover for dinner with his son each night.</p><p>As the boy grew older, the time between his parents\u2019 visits grew longer until, one year, they did not return at all. Professor Lymere tearfully admitted that they had most likely perished, somewhere out in the desert.</p><p>But Ezreal could not accept that. They had been too careful in their preparations. They must still be out there, <i>somewhere</i>\u2026</p><p>Abandoning his reluctant studies, the budding explorer would strike out on his own. He knew, if he was ever to find his mother and father, he had to start with the final resting place of Ne\u2019Zuk. He spent weeks secretly gathering supplies from the university\u2014celestial diagrams, translations of runic sigils, guides on the burial rites of Shurima, and a pair of protective goggles. Leaving a note of farewell for his uncle, he snuck onto a supply ship bound for Nashramae.</p><p>Following his mother\u2019s meticulous field notes, he crossed the Great Sai with merchant caravans heading south. For many months, he delved into cavernous ruins beneath the shifting sands, relishing the freedom of the unknown, facing unspeakable horrors that guarded hidden chambers. With each step, Ezreal imagined himself following his parents\u2019 path, drawing ever closer to solving the mystery of their disappearance.</p><p>Finally, he managed what they evidently had not. Beneath the newer mausoleum of some unnamed emperor, he uncovered the tomb of Ne\u2019Zuk.</p><p>The great sarcophagus lay empty, save for a gleaming bronze gauntlet, with a bright, crystalline matrix at its center. As soon as Ezreal laid his hands upon it, the tomb itself seemed to turn upon him, with cunningly wrought traps and wards laid down thousands of years ago. With scarcely a thought, he donned the gauntlet and blasted his way through, even teleporting the last hundred yards back to the hidden entrance before the whole structure collapsed in a plume of sand and masonry dust.</p><p>Breathing hard, Ezreal looked down at the gauntlet as it hummed along with his heartbeat. He could feel it siphoning and amplifying his own essence. This, he realized, was a fearsome weapon of a previous age. A weapon fit for a god-warrior of Shurima, and the perfect tool for an explorer.</p><p>Soon after returning to Piltover, Ezreal found himself bounding from adventure to adventure. From lost cities to mystical temples, his nose for treasure-seeking led him to places most university professors could only read about on maps, and his reputation began to grow. Naturally, to Ezreal\u2019s mind, these tales rarely conveyed the true scope and scale of his exploits\u2026 but they did give him an idea. If he could make a name for himself as the greatest adventurer in the world, then his parents would surely return, and seek him out in person. </p><p>From the untamed borders of Noxus and Demacia, to the seedy depths of Zaun, and the frozen wilderness of the Freljord\u2014Ezreal chases fame and glory, uncovering long-lost artifacts and solving the riddles of history. While some may dispute the details of his anecdotes, or call his methods into question, he never answers his critics.</p><p>After all, they\u2019re clearly just jealous.<br></p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>A dashing adventurer, unknowingly gifted in the magical arts, Ezreal raids long-lost catacombs, tangles with ancient curses, and overcomes seemingly impossible odds with ease. His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts. One thing is for sure\u2014whenever Ezreal is around, trouble isn\u2019t too far behind. Or ahead. Probably everywhere.</p>",

What stepped before the boy was something older than recorded history. Something darker than a yawning, starless night. Something the world had desperately tried to forget\u2014and in an instant, the mage, the creature, and the tower itself were lost to all of time.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what the stories say.</p><p>In the Freljord, children frighten each other around the fire with tales of a monster that raises itself from untended graves in the ice, its body a shambling mass of helmets, bucklers, furs, and wood. In Bilgewater, drunken sailors trade accounts of something standing alone on a tiny, distant atoll from which no one has ever returned. An old Targonian legend speaks of how a child of twilight stole the only joy from a ragged, whispering horror, while veteran Noxian soldiers prefer the fable of a lonely farmhand who was blamed for a poor harvest and fed to the crows, later returning to the world as a demon.</p><p>Demacia. Ixtal. Piltover. Ionia. Shurima. In every corner of Runeterra, these myths persist\u2014reshaped, respun, and passed down by countless generations of storytellers. Stories of a thing that looks almost human and stalks places thick with fear.</p><p>But these are simply fables to frighten young children. No one would ever be afraid of a silly old monster called Fiddlesticks\u2026</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Something has awoken in the Demacian hinterlands, drawn by the climate of rising fear and paranoia. Rural protectorates, separated from the capital by hundreds of miles of farmland, are emptying in mere days. Travelers vanish from the old footpaths. Guard patrols fail to report back from the edges of the kingdom. And wild-eyed survivors claw at their faces from the safety of roadside taverns, wailing of crows that aren\u2019t crows, sounds that aren\u2019t sounds, and a lopsided horror in the shape of a scarecrow that croaks in the stolen voices of the dead.</p><p>Most blame rogue mages. Such accusations are common in these days of rebellion.</p><p>Yet the truth is far worse. Something <i>has</i> returned, just as it had in the fictitious tale of the young mage in his seaside tower. An evil gone from the world for numberless centuries\u2014long enough that the warnings of a nascent humanity passed into rumor, then myth, then legend\u2026 until all that remained were simple fables. An entity so utterly alien that it defies almost all contemporary knowledge of magic. So impossibly ancient that it has always <i>been</i>. So universally feared that even animals grow nervous when someone speaks its name.</p><p>In the wake of this revival, another tale, nearly lost to memory, has seen a resurgence throughout the hinterlands. A legend of a great evil that has no form, no thoughts, and no understanding of the world it inhabits, instead building itself into the crude shape of those that fear it. The terror of all living things, given life in that first terrible scream of creation. A demon before demons were known.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what the stories say.</p><p>But Fiddlesticks is real.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>As the youngest daughter of the noble Laurent family, Fiora seemed destined for a life as a political pawn, to be married off in Demacia\u2019s grand game of alliances. This did not sit well, and from an early age she deliberately defied every expectation placed upon her. Her mother had the finest craftsmen of Demacia fashion the most lifelike dolls for her to play with\u2014but Fiora gave them to her maids, and took up her eldest brother's rapier, forcing him to give her lessons in secret. Her father obtained a set of dressmaking mannequins for her personal seamstress to craft wondrous gowns\u2014but Fiora merely used them to practice her lunges and ripostes.</p><p>Despite her years of quiet resistance, a politically advantageous marriage was eventually arranged with an outlying branch of the Crownguard family, after her eighteenth birthday. Plans were set for a summer wedding. It would take place in the capital, and King Jarvan III himself was to attend.</p><p>On that day, as the invited guests began to arrive, Fiora stood up and declared that she would sooner die than allow someone else to decide the course of her life. Her betrothed was publicly shamed by this outburst, and his family demanded satisfaction in the old manner\u2014a duel to the death.</p><p>Fiora immediately agreed, but her father Sebastien implored the king to intervene. Jarvan had done much to end such feuding among the nobility, but in this case his hands were tied. Fiora had already accepted.</p><p>There was only one option left. Sebastien invoked his right to fight in her place.</p><p>High Marshal Tianna Crownguard likewise named a champion to fight for her kinsman, selecting a veteran warrior from the Dauntless Vanguard. Sebastien\u2019s defeat seemed almost certain. The Laurent name would be ruined, and Fiora exiled in disgrace. Presented with so stark a choice, he made a decision that could damn his family for years to come\u2026</p><p>The night before the duel, he attempted to slip his opponent a draught that would dull his senses and slow his reactions\u2014but he was caught in the act, and arrested.</p><p>The law was clear. Sebastien Laurent had broken the most fundamental code of honor. He would be humiliated upon the executioner\u2019s scaffold, hanged like a common criminal. On the eve of his death, Fiora visited his cell, but what passed between them remains a secret known only to her.</p><p>The next day, Fiora approached the king\u2019s dais in full view of the crowd. She knelt before him, and offered up her blade\u2014with his blessing, she would claim the Laurent name from her father, and justice would be served. The duel was blindingly swift, a dance of blades so exquisite that those present would never forget what they witnessed. Fiora\u2019s father was a fine swordsman in his own right, but he was no match for his daughter. They said farewell in every clash of steel, but in the end Fiora tearfully buried her rapier in her father\u2019s heart.</p><p>Solemnly, King Jarvan ruled that Sebastien had paid for his crimes in full. Fiora would be his successor. The quarrel between the families was resolved, and that would be an end to it.</p><p>Even so, such scandals are not easily forgotten. Fiora took to her new duties at court with her customary clarity and directness, but found that rumors and gossip continued to follow her at every turn. She had usurped her brothers\u2019 claims to the family name. What could this arrogant child bring to the Great City of Demacia but more strife and bloodshed, if she would not take a husband?</p><p>Rather than demand more justice at the edge of her sword, Fiora instead turned to her wider family\u2014cousins and more distant relatives, with many renowned swordmasters among them\u2014and silenced her critics by granting noble status to all in her household. Together, they were dedicated to the refinement of bladecraft within the kingdom. Dueling was an ancient art, but need not <i>always</i> end in death.</p><p>And if any care to disagree with that notion, Fiora will be only too happy to test the strength of their conviction in combat herself.</p>",

In the depths of what is now the Guardian\u2019s Sea, a great city once stood\u2014it was here that the yordle Fizz made his home. He lived alongside the artisans and warriors of that proud, noble race. Even though he was not one of them, they treated him as an equal, and his playful nature and tall tales of adventures in the open sea made him welcome at any gathering.</p><p>But the world was changing. The oceans were growing warmer, emboldening fierce predators to rise up from the deepest trenches. Other settlements had fallen silent, but the rulers of the great city could still not agree on how to deal with the threat. Fizz pledged to roam the seas in search of survivors, or anyone who knew what had happened.</p><p>Then, one dark day, the gigalodons came.</p><p>These huge dragon-sharks stunned their prey with fell shrieking, and the avenues of the great city were soon clouded red. Thousands died in a matter of hours, the immense bulk of their killers crushing towers and temples in a monstrous feeding frenzy. Scenting blood in the water, Fizz raced back, determined to join the fight and save the city.</p><p>He was too late. There was nothing left of the city to save. When the debris finally settled, not a single living creature remained, nor any stone upon another, and the ravenous shoal had moved on. Alone in the cold depths, Fizz sank into mournful despair. As his yordle magic began to fade, he let himself be carried by the currents, drifting in a catatonic torpor, dreaming away the millennia\u2026</p><p>It was only chance that reawakened him. A handful of copper coins fell from above, scattered to the seabed in the wake of a huge, <i>wooden</i> fish that swam upon the surface. This was no gigalodon, but Fizz was alarmed nonetheless\u2014he knew little of the world overhead, but surely no fish could survive up there? He ventured up and peered into the salty air for the first time.</p><p>There were people, people who lived outside of the water and sailed in wooden fish of all sizes. Fizz found the thought both frightening and exciting, but the curious gifts they cast into the water made it clear that they wanted to be his friends. In time, following their movements to and fro across the oceans, he came to the port city of Bilgewater.</p><p>To the inhabitants of that lawless place, this strange and slippery creature quickly became something of a legend\u2014the Tidal Trickster, a spirit of the ocean itself. It is said that he can summon great beasts to do his bidding, hole a ship\u2019s hull with his stone trident, and breathe air or water as it suits him. Many a misbehaving child has been warned on a moonless night: \u201cGo quickly to sleep, or the Trickster will come and feed you to the fishes\u2026\u201d</p><p>Fizz is good-natured, but mischievous even for a yordle, and delights in confounding the people of Bilgewater. The most seasoned fishermen know, just as the ocean may rise and fall, the Tidal Trickster is as likely to lead them into windless doldrums as to an easy catch that would fill their nets. Even so, Fizz does not take kindly to the greedy or selfish, and more than one haughty sea captain hoping to make a quick pile of silver has found that her mysterious guide has led her crew not to safety, but to shipwreck.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Galio\u2019s legend begins in the aftermath of the Rune Wars, when countless refugees fled from the destructive power of magic. In the west of Valoran, a band of these displaced people were hounded by a vicious band of dark mages\u2014exhausted from days without rest, the refugees hid among the shadows of an ancient, petrified forest, and their pursuers suddenly found their magic to be ineffective.</p><p>It seemed the fossilized trees were a natural magic-dampener, and any sorcery used within them would simply fail. No longer helpless, the refugees turned their swords on the dark mages and drove them from the land.</p><p>Some decided that this sanctuary from magic was a gift from the gods, others saw it as a fair reward for their terrible journey, but all agreed this should be their new home.</p><p>As years passed, the settlers crafted items of protection from the enchanted wood. Eventually, they found it could be mixed with ash and lime to make petricite\u2014a material with a powerful resistance to magic. It would be the foundation for their new civilization, forming the walls of the new kingdom of Demacia.</p><p>For years, these petricite barriers were all the Demacians needed to feel secure from the threat of magic within the borders of their homeland. In the rare event that they needed to settle a conflict abroad, their military proved fierce and formidable\u2026 but when their enemies employed sorcery, Demacia\u2019s roaming army had little recourse. Somehow, they needed to take the security of their magic-dampening walls into battle.</p><p>The sculptor Durand was commissioned to fashion some manner of petricite shield for the military, and two years later the artist unveiled his masterpiece. While it was not what many were expecting, the winged statue Galio would become vital to the defense of the nation, and serve as a symbol of Demacia across Valoran.</p><p>Using a system of pulleys, steel sledges, and countless oxen, they would pull the great stone figure to the battlefield. Many would-be invaders simply froze at the sight of the awe-inspiring silhouette looming before them\u2014the titan who \u201cate magic\u201d inspired a kingdom, and terrified those who opposed it.</p><p>However, no one thought to consider what exposing the statue to such unpredictable energies might do\u2026</p><p>Demacia had been mired in battle with enemy forces in the Greenfang Mountains. A skilled order of warmages, known as the Arcane Fist, bombarded the Demacians with crackling bolts of raw, mystical power for thirteen days. Those who had survived this long felt their morale dwindling, and huddled close to Galio. Just when their spirits could be brought no lower, a slow, deafening rumble shook the vale, as if two mountains were grinding against each other. As a great shadow grew above them, the Demacian soldiers steeled themselves for death.</p><p>A deep voice bellowed from above. To the Demacians\u2019 astonishment, the sound came from the colossus at their backs\u2014Galio was moving, and speaking, entirely on his own. Somehow, the accumulation of absorbed magic had given him life. He threw himself in front of the Demacians, shielding them from attack after attack, absorbing each fresh bolt into his massive, stone frame.</p><p>Then Galio turned, bounded up the mountainside, and crushed every last one of the Arcane Fist into the craggy soil.</p><p>The Demacians cheered. They were eager to thank the petricite sentinel that had saved them\u2026 but as quickly as he\u2019d come to life, their fearsome protector had ceased moving, returning to his pedestal, just as before. Back in the Great City, this bizarre tale was told in hushed tones by the few who had survived the Battle of the Greenfangs, and was usually received with silent incredulity. That day passed into legend\u2014perhaps a mere allegory of ancient days to help people through hard times.</p><p>Certainly, no one would have believed that the colossus continued to see all that transpired around him. Even while immobile, Galio retained consciousness, longing to experience the sensations of battle once again.</p><p>He watched mortals pass beneath him, paying him tribute year after year. It puzzled him to see them disappear one by one as time rolled on. Galio wondered where they went when they vanished. Perhaps they were sent away to be mended, as he often was when he returned from war?</p><p>As the years slipped by, Galio began to realize the sorrowful answer to his question\u2014unlike himself, the people of Demacia could not be repainted, or have their damage easily repaired. Mortals were frail, ephemeral creatures, and he now understood just how badly they needed his protection. Fighting had been his passion, but the people were now his purpose.</p><p>Even so, Galio has been called to battle only a handful of times in all the centuries since. Demacia has begun to look inward, with magic becoming rarer in his world than it once was, and so the petricite colossus remains dormant, observing the world through the murk of his waking dreams. The statue\u2019s greatest hope is to be blessed by a magic so powerful that he will never be forced to sleep again.</p><p>Only then will Galio be able to truly serve his purpose: to stand and fight as Demacia\u2019s protector, forevermore.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Outside the Great City of Demacia, the stone colossus Galio keeps vigilant watch. Built as a bulwark against enemy mages, he often stands motionless for decades until the presence of powerful magic stirs him to life. Once activated, Galio makes the most of his time, savoring the thrill of a fight and the rare honor of defending his countrymen. But his triumphs are always bittersweet, for the magic he destroys is also his source of reanimation, and each victory leaves him dormant once again.",

He takes grim pleasure in the ever-increasing rewards posted for his head, and makes sure to nail them to the Bounty Board in Bilgewater for all to see whenever he returns to port, his ships heavy with loot.</p><p>In recent times, Gangplank has been brought down by the machinations of the bounty hunter Miss Fortune. His ship was destroyed with all of Bilgewater watching, killing his crew and shattering his aura of invincibility. Now that they have seen he is vulnerable, the gangs of Bilgewater have risen up, fighting amongst themselves to claim dominion over the port city. </p><p>Despite receiving horrific injuries in the explosion, Gangplank survived.

                "lore_full": "<p>Born into the noble Crownguard family, along with his younger sister Lux, Garen knew from an early age that he would be expected to defend the throne of Demacia with his life. His father, Pieter, was a decorated military officer, while his aunt Tianna was Sword-Captain of the elite Dauntless Vanguard\u2014and both were recognized and greatly respected by King Jarvan III. It was assumed that Garen would eventually come to serve the king\u2019s son in the same manner.</p><p>The kingdom of Demacia had risen from the ashes of the Rune Wars, and the centuries afterward were plagued with further conflict and strife. One of Garen\u2019s uncles, a ranger-knight in the Demacian military, told young Garen and Lux his tales of venturing outside the kingdom\u2019s walls to protect its people from the dangers of the world beyond.</p><p>He warned them that, one day, something would undoubtedly end this time of relative peace\u2014whether it be rogue mages, creatures of the abyss, or some other unimaginable horror yet to come.</p><p>As if to confirm those fears, their uncle was killed in the line of duty by a mage, before Garen turned eleven. Garen saw the pain this brought to his family, and the fear in his young sister\u2019s eyes. He knew then, for certain, that magic was the first and greatest peril that Demacia faced, and he vowed never to let it within their walls. Only by following their founding ideals, and by displaying their unshakeable pride, could the kingdom be kept safe.</p><p>At the age of twelve, Garen left the Crownguard home in High Silvermere to join the military. As a squire, his days and nights were consumed by training and the study of war, honing his body and mind into a weapon as strong and true as Demacian steel. It was then that he first met young Jarvan IV\u2014the prince who, as king, he would one day serve\u2014among the other recruits, and the two became inseparable.</p><p>In the years that followed, Garen earned his place in the shieldwall as a warrior of Demacia, and quickly gained a fearsome reputation on the battlefield. By the time he was eighteen, he had served with honor in campaigns along the Freljordian borders, played a key role in purging fetid cultists from the Silent Forest, and fought alongside the valiant defenders of Whiterock.</p><p>King Jarvan III himself summoned Garen\u2019s battalion back to the Great City of Demacia, honoring them before the royal court in the Hall of Valor. Tianna Crownguard, recently elevated to the role of High Marshal, singled out her nephew in particular, and recommended him for the trials necessary to join the ranks of the Dauntless Vanguard.</p><p>Garen returned home in preparation, and was greeted warmly by Lux and his parents, as well as the common people living on his family\u2019s estate. Though he was pleased to see his sister growing into an intelligent, capable young woman, something about her had changed. He had noticed it whenever he visited, but now Garen wrestled with a real and gnawing suspicion that Lux possessed magical powers\u2026 though he never let himself entertain the idea for long. The thought of a <i>Crownguard</i> being capable of the same forbidden sorceries that had slain their uncle was too unbearable to confront.</p><p>Naturally, through courage and skill, Garen won his place among the Vanguard. With his proud family and his good friend the prince looking on, he took his oaths before the throne.</p><p>Lux and her mother spent much more time in the capital, in service to the king as well as the humble order of the Illuminators\u2014yet Garen tried to keep his distance as much as possible. Though he loved his sister more than anything else in the world, some small part of him had a hard time getting close to her, and he tried not to think about what he would be forced to do if his suspicions were ever confirmed. Instead, he threw himself into his new duties, fighting and training twice as hard as he had before.</p><p>When the new Sword-Captain of the Dauntless Vanguard fell in battle, Garen found himself put forward for command by his fellow warriors, and the nomination was unopposed.</p><p>To this day, he stands resolute in the defense of his homeland, against all foes. Far more than Demacia's most formidable soldier, he is the very embodiment of all the greatest and most noble ideals upon which it was founded.</p>",

He is popular among his fellows, and respected well enough by his enemies\u2014not least as a scion of the prestigious Crownguard family, entrusted with defending Demacia and its ideals. Clad in magic-resistant armor and bearing a mighty broadsword, Garen stands ready to confront mages and sorcerers on the field of battle, in a veritable whirlwind of righteous steel.",

Though barely big enough to leave footprints in the snow, his temper rivaled that of beasts ten times his size, and he would erupt with a babble of curses the moment anything went amiss. For this reason, he felt more kinship with the greater and wiser creatures, who kept their distance from mortals. To Gnar, they looked like overgrown, white-furred yordles\u2026 and that was good enough for him.</p><p>While the tribes foraged across the tundra, gathering wild berries and tasty moss, Gnar collected more essential items, like rocks, pebbles, and the muddy remains of dead birds. His greatest treasure was the jawbone of a dr\u00fcvask. When he tugged it from the cold earth, he squealed with glee and flung it as far as he could.</p><p>It landed two hops away.</p><p>Thrilled by this early success, Gnar carried his \u201cboomerang\u201d wherever he went. The world would try its best to offer him new delights\u2014shiny lint, sweet nectar, round things\u2014but none could match the pure joy he felt in throwing and catching his cherished weapon. He now considered himself a hunter, and trailed herds of wild beasts that paid him no mind.</p><p>But even he could sense change coming to the land. The sky seemed darker. The winds felt colder. The mortal tribes who had once foraged together, now appeared to hunt each other\u2026</p><p>The big white yordles would know what to do. Gnar would go to them.</p><p>Using all of his hunting skill, he tracked them into the snow-capped peaks of a vast mountain range, much farther than he had ever wandered before. As he approached unseen, he also saw more mortals than he could count. This was exciting, but no one else seemed too happy about it.</p><p>Then the ground shook, and split apart. For the first time in Gnar\u2019s life, it seemed as though <i>everyone else</i> was throwing tantrums. The mortals yelled. The big yordles roared.</p><p>But the monster\u2019s arrival silenced them all.</p><p>Heaving itself up from the newly opened abyss, it bore huge horns, whipping tentacles, and a single eye, burning with strange light that made the fur on Gnar\u2019s back crawl. While some mortals fled at the sight, he began to feel an odd pain in his chest\u2014it was like the thought of losing his boomerang, or never being hugged again. This horrible thing wanted to hurt his new friends.</p><p>And this made him angry. In that moment, Gnar <i>truly</i> raged.</p><p>All he could see was the monster. In a flash, he was in the air, leaping toward it. In one paw, he grasped a snowball\u2026 or so he thought. In fact, it was a boulder plucked from the mountainside, for Gnar had grown as large as the big white yordles. He would send this monster back where it came from, by walloping its face!</p><p>But the blow never landed. Gnar felt a chill colder than any winter, one that seemed to turn the air itself into ice\u2014truly, this elemental magic froze him in place, biting through his shaggy fur. Everything, including the monster, became quiet. The yordle\u2019s strength and anger melted away. A deep tiredness crept into his limbs, and he fell softly asleep.</p><p>Gnar napped for a long time. When he finally awoke, he shook the frost from his shoulders, breathing heavily. Everyone else was gone. With no monsters to fight and no friends to protect, he felt very small and alone again.</p><p>The land was very different, too. There was snow <i>everywhere</i>, blanketing everything as far as his wide eyes could see.

True to his nature, Gragas replied with a diplomatic headbutt, setting off a brawl matched only in the legends of the Freljord.<br><br>When the fallen from that great melee finally awoke, Ashe proposed a friendly drink as an alternative to fighting. With their tempers doused in suds, the two tribes, formerly on the brink of war, bonded over a common love of Gragas' brew.

                "lore_full": "<p>Raised in the wharf alleys of Bilgewater, Malcolm Graves quickly learned how to fight and how to steal, skills that would serve him very well in all the years ahead. He could always find work hauling contraband up from the smugglers\u2019 skiffs that came into the bay each night\u2014with a tidy side-gig as hired muscle for various other unsavory local characters, as they went about their business in the port.</p>\n<p>But the alleys were small-time, and he craved more excitement than they could offer. Still little more than a youth, Graves stole a blunderbuss and smuggled himself aboard a ship headed out of Bilgewater to the Shuriman mainland, where he stole, lied, and gambled his way from place to place along the coast.</p>\n<p>Across the table of a high-stakes\u2014and highly illegal\u2014card game in Mudtown, Graves met a man who would change the course of his life, and his career: the trickster now known to many as Twisted Fate.</p>\n<p>Each immediately saw in the other the same reckless passion for danger and adventure, and together they formed a most lucrative partnership. Between Graves\u2019 raw brawn and Twisted Fate\u2019s ability to talk his way out of (and <em>occasionally</em> back into) almost any situation, they were an unusually effective team from the outset. Their mutual sense of roguish honor grew into genuine trust, and together they stole from the rich, swindled the foolish, handpicked skilled crews for specific jobs, and sold out their rivals whenever they could.</p>\n<p>Though at times Twisted Fate would blow all their shares and leave them with nothing to show for it, Graves knew that the thrill of some new escapade was always just around the corner\u2026</p>\n<p>On the southern borderlands of Valoran, they set two renowned noble houses of Noxus at each other\u2019s throats as cover for the rescue of a kidnapped heir. That they pocketed the reward money, only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder, should really have come as no surprise to their original employer. In Piltover, they still hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the pair empty the vault of all its treasures, they also tricked the guards into loading the loot onto their hijacked schooner, for a quick getaway through the Sun Gates.</p>\n<p>In almost every case, only once they and their accomplices were safely over the horizon were their crimes even discovered\u2014usually along with one of Twisted Fate\u2019s trademark calling cards left where it would be easily found.</p>\n<p>But, eventually, their luck ran out.</p>\n<p>During a heist that rapidly turned from complex to completely botched, Graves was taken by the local enforcers, while Twisted Fate merely turned tail and abandoned him.</p>\n<p>Thrown into the infamous prison known as the Locker, Graves endured years of torture and solitary confinement, during which time he nursed his bitter anger toward his old partner. A lesser man would surely have been broken by all this, but not Malcolm Graves. He was determined to have his revenge.</p>\n<p>When he finally clawed his way to freedom, with the prison warden\u2019s brand new shotgun slung over his shoulder, Graves began his long-overdue pursuit of Twisted Fate.</p>\n<p>The search led him back home to Bilgewater, where he found that the wily old cardsharp had acquired a few new bounties on his head\u2014and Graves would be only too happy to claim them. However, just as he got Twisted Fate in his sights, they were forced to put aside their differences in order to escape almost certain death in the ongoing conflict between the reaver king Gangplank and his rival ship captains.</p>\n<p>Once again, Graves found himself escaping his hometown\u2026 only this time, he had his old friend in tow. While both of them might have liked to pick up their partnership where they left off all those years ago, such resentment couldn't simply be forgotten overnight, and it would be a while before Graves could bring himself to trust Twisted Fate again.</p>\n<p>Still, he feels Bilgewater calling to him once more. Maybe <em>this</em> time around, the pair of them will find their stride and be able to pull off the ultimate heist\u2026</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Within the long-lost kingdom of Camavor, there once lived a village of people far from the throne. It was here, in the rural colonies, where a humble seamstress made her beloved doll, Gwen.</p><p>What Gwen can remember of her past, she remembers with love. The seamstress and the doll spent their days crafting, scissors resting in Gwen\u2019s still hands as her maker stitched nearby with needle and thread. At night, the two could be found crouched under the dinner table, the seamstress challenging Gwen to makeshift duels, the clash of silverware against scissors echoing in their candlelit kitchen.</p><p>In time, the games stopped and the light faded. Gwen could not understand why, but whenever she struggled to recall details, she felt a twinge of pain, tied to a man whose name and face escaped her. As her memories washed away with the ocean tide, Gwen lay still for centuries, quiet and forgotten.</p><p>Then one night, her eyes opened. Gwen awoke for the very first time on a shadowy beach far from her home. By magic unbeknownst to her, she had been transformed into a living girl who could move her hands and feet\u2014all on her own!</p><p>Gwen took to life with joy. She skipped across the sand, amazed by how far her eyes could see, how wondrous every pebble was to her touch, and how incredible the wind felt on her back. Along the coast, scattered debris left abandoned for a millennium caught her attention. Lying beside broken chests were oddly familiar tools.</p><p>Scissors. Needles. Thread.</p><p>Gwen recognized them immediately. These were her maker\u2019s tools. When her fingers touched them, a burst of mist glinting with light flowed from her hands. To her, it felt safe and warm, like the soothing embrace of a hallowed past.</p><p>But Gwen was not the only one drawn to this magic.</p><p>Lurking in the isles, a different mist swarmed. Black in color, it coiled and twisted, forming into fearsome wraiths. Something within Gwen\u2019s newfound presence attracted them\u2014something they hungered for with obsession.</p><p>As the wraiths came for her, Gwen was undeterred. She thrust her scissors at them. To her delight, more of her mist filled the air, enchanting the size and strength of her tools and turning them from mere steel into spectral magic.</p><p>But the wraiths were relentless. They swelled in number, fueled by the ever-growing Black Mist. Gwen began to feel a tragic, strangely familiar pain. Surrounded by wraiths, suppressed memories surfaced. She recalled images of her maker, sick and wounded, lying in anguish. Near her was a man whose face finally returned to Gwen.</p><p><i>Viego</i>.</p><p>Remembering his name brought Gwen to her knees. Wistfully, she reflected on the bygone moments spent with her maker\u2014a happier, simpler time\u2014and stole one final glance at her scissors...<span class='sol-ascii-text'>8<-8<-8<-8<-</span></p><p>It was then Gwen realized something amazing. Her maker, victim to that man\u2019s twisted vanity, was not fully gone. The seamstress\u2019 tools, the very tools that first sewed and stitched Gwen together, were now in her hands. Gwen believed this was no accident. She knew, deep down, her maker was still with her, still fighting.</p><p>This was a gift Gwen would not take for granted.</p><p>Grasping needles and thread, she spun clouds of Hallowed Mist to push back the swarming wraiths. Her scissors slashed hard and fast, reminiscent of those blissful nights when her maker imagined grand battles beneath their kitchen table. Soon, the wraiths were no more.</p><p>Though triumphant, Gwen recognized this was only the beginning. She could sense these wraiths and Viego were linked, both responsible for the spread of immense pain. With no time to lose, she resolved to track the Black Mist and stop it at any cost. Gwen expected this endeavor to be strenuous, yet she reveled in every second of being alive\u2014for who knew how long this blessing would last?</p><p>Having been given a unique chance at life, Gwen chooses to be an indomitable, positive force against all odds. She journeys across Runeterra, determined to restore joy to those who are hurt and suffering. To Gwen, each moment is precious, and each step driven with purpose.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Life had not always been good to Renata Glasc.</p>\n<p>Her parents were brilliant alchemists, focused on innovations for the healing arts. Dedicated to their work and their community in Zaun, they gave their care and their cures to anyone in need... regardless of whether their patients could afford them. Renata grew up accustomed to going to bed hungry, resentful of her parents\u2019 ideology, yet powerless to change her circumstances. She dreamed of the ships that sailed through Piltover\u2019s Sun Gate canal, imagining herself taking the wheel and steering her life in a new direction\u2014toward the riches of the world.</p>\n<p>When she was old enough to join the family business, it was quickly discerned that Renata had no aptitude for alchemy. She did, however, have ideas about turning a profit. In her first sales pitch, Renata convinced her parents that they wouldn\u2019t need to ask anything more than people could give, <em>if</em> they started treating wealthier Zaunites. With loyal patients extolling the Glascs\u2019 talents to their betters, their charity work was soon paid for by the rates Renata set for the rich.</p>\n<p>Instead of living comfortably, however, the Glascs spent that money developing a highly refined chemtech formula to extend the lives of their sickest patients. No matter what they did, the formula always had unwanted side effects\u2014such as making their patients extremely suggestible, or extremely violent\u2014so they continued to try and improve their work. Only Renata, bitter at what her parents chose to do with the money she had earned them, wondered if the formula could be useful as is.</p>\n<p>Up in Piltover, the elite clan leaders who had been making money off of Zaunite medical stopgaps heard whispers of the Glasc family\u2019s research. Not willing to let anything threaten their bottom line, they paid off a handful of enforcers to \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Renata woke to the sound of her parents\u2019 screams as her home burned down around them. She lost her arm trying\u2014and failing\u2014to save them.</p>\n<p>With only her family name and the scraps of research that survived the fire, Renata swore to avoid her parents\u2019 mistake of thankless altruism. Instead, she threw herself into building her meager inheritance into something bigger, something that could give her everything she\u2019d never had, something that would give her money and power and control. An <em>empire</em>.</p>\n<p>As the years passed, she became the brains behind several successful small-time operations while building relationships with unsavory, but influential, individuals throughout the city. She\u2019d give people jobs, lend them money, and give them medicine for their sick children\u2014but never for free. If they couldn\u2019t pay in coin, she demanded their loyalty.</p>\n<p>Renata quickly realized that genius was the rarest and most lucrative commodity in Zaun and devised a plan to invest in destitute youths with a talent for innovation. She offered a space to work and stability for their families in exchange for their work in perpetuity. The poorest among them couldn\u2019t afford to say no. Renata found herself with plentiful access to new and unique product designs, and novel uses for the chemtech formula that was her parents\u2019 legacy. Profits soared. She then established Glasc Industries after purchasing the first of what would eventually be dozens of factories to manufacture her high-end chemtech products.</p>\n<p>Glasc Industries quickly expanded across Zaun\u2014from chemtech mining operations to dance halls to refineries\u2014angering some barons who\u2019d held monopolies over the ventures. But, one by one, Renata persuaded them all to go into business with her. And just like that, Renata quietly managed to become a chem-baron in her own right, and no one could push back for fear of upsetting their own cash flow. While Glasc Industries flourished, Renata herself remained in the shadows, waiting for the right time to make her next move.</p>\n<p>That time came after a chemical accident sent poisonous fumes sweeping through the streets of Zaun, leaving the city in its worst state in decades. Amidst the noxious gray clouds, Glasc Industries offered basic breathers and replacement filters to everyone in the city\u2026 for free. Now everyone in Zaun knew of Renata Glasc and her benevolence. She had earned Zaun\u2019s loyalty.</p>\n<p>Word of her generosity swept through Piltover, as well. For the first time, shopkeepers looked seriously at Renata\u2019s elegant and ultra-refined chemtech designs and soon lined their shelves with her products.</p>\n<p>Now, every fashionable Piltovan owns at least one Glasc Industries product, and the wealthiest among them vie to sit beside Renata at novelty galas and the opera house. But Renata\u2019s plan was never to be a chem-baron in Zaun or the corporate darling of Piltover.</p>\n<p>No, she aims to take Piltover\u2019s source of financial power for herself\u2014the Sun Gate she had dreamed of so often in her youth. For she who controls the Sun Gate, controls the flow of trade; and she who controls the trade, controls the world. With a secret cache of her parents\u2019 chemtech formula embedded in every Glasc product in both Piltover and Zaun, ready to be released at her command\u2014side effects and all\u2014it\u2019s only a matter of time before <em>everyone</em> works for Renata Glasc.</p>",

Work with her, and be rewarded beyond measure. Work against her, and live to regret it. But everyone comes to her side, eventually.</p>",

His obsessive hunger for glory was eroding his honor, and over time the knight-commander came to realize this young lieutenant must never lead them.</p>\n<p>When he was told this, Hecarim was furious. Even so, he bit back his anger, and continued in his duties.</p>\n<p>When they next rode to war, the commander found himself surrounded by enemies, and cut off from his fellow knights. Hecarim, seeing his chance, turned away and left him to die. At battle\u2019s end, the Iron Order, oblivious to what Hecarim had done, knelt on the bloody ground and swore allegiance to him.</p>\n<p>Hecarim rode to the capital to take his formal oaths, and met with Kalista, the king\u2019s most trusted general. She recognized his prowess and leadership, and when the queen was wounded by an assassin\u2019s poisoned blade, Kalista was comforted to know the Iron Order would remain with the king while she sought a cure.</p>\n<p>Gripped by paranoia, and seeing new threats in every shadow, the king raged at those he believed were trying to separate him from his dying wife, and dispatched Hecarim to quell dissent throughout the kingdom. The Iron Order earned a dreadful reputation as ruthless enforcers of the king\u2019s will. Towns and villages burned. Hundreds were put to the sword.</p>\n<p>With grim inevitability, when the queen died, Hecarim chose to sour the king\u2019s grief into hatred, seeking sanction to lead the Iron Order into foreign lands. He would avenge her death, while earning yet more dark renown for himself.</p>\n<p>But before they could ride out, Kalista returned. She had found what she sought upon the distant Blessed Isles\u2014and yet it was now too late. The king would not believe this, and had Kalista imprisoned as a traitor. Intrigued by what he had heard, Hecarim visited her cell, and they spoke of the pale mists that protected the islands from all invaders\u2026 and also of the inhabitants\u2019 immense wealth, including the legendary Waters of Life.</p>\n<p>Knowing only Kalista could lead them there, Hecarim eventually persuaded her to guide the king\u2019s fleet through the veil that concealed the Blessed Isles from mortal sight.</p>\n<p>They landed at the city of Helia with the queen\u2019s body in solemn procession. The Iron Order led the way, only to be met by the city\u2019s masters, who now refused to help. Enraged, the king ordered Kalista to kill them, but she refused, and Hecarim smiled as he made the decision that would damn him for eternity. He drove a spear through Kalista\u2019s back, and ordered his knights to ransack the city, looting its vaults of arcane treasures.</p>\n<p>Amid the chaos, a lowly custodian agreed to grant the king access to the Waters of Life\u2014but not even this could distract Hecarim from the revelry of bloodshed, and so it was that the Ruination of the Blessed Isles would take him almost completely by surprise.</p>\n<p>A blastwave of magical force tore across Helia, shattering every last building and leaving the fragments suspended in searing un-light. In its wake came the Black Mist, a billowing hurricane that dragged every living creature it touched into its shrieking, roiling embrace. Hecarim tried to rally the Iron Order, hoping to make it back to their ships, but the mist claimed them one by one as they fled.</p>\n<p>Alone, and defiant to the end, the knight-commander was taken by the shadows. He and his mighty steed were fused into a monstrous, spectral abomination that reflected the darkness in Hecarim\u2019s heart\u2014a brazen creature of fury and spite, at one with the Black Mist and yet utterly enslaved by it.</p>\n<p>Bound forevermore to these Shadow Isles, Hecarim has spent centuries in a sinister mockery of his former life, cursed to patrol the nightmarish lands he once intended to conquer. Whenever the Black Mist reaches out beyond their shores, he and the otherworldly host of the Iron Order ride out to slaughter the living, in memory of glories long passed.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>In northwest Ionia, the island of Koyehn once stood beautiful and serene. Among its golden sands, seasonal bazaar, and quaint mill town sat the Temple of Koyehn, an ancient and renowned conservatory for the arts.</p>\n\n<p>Lukai Hwei was born to inherit this temple.</p>\n\n<p>Kind and precocious, Hwei spent his childhood putting to canvas his wild daydreams, which exaggerated the world around him into surreal, fantastical sights. He knew these visions differed from reality, but through them, he saw life itself as art. So connected was Hwei to the shades of the world that even his eye color shifted in hue to reflect his mind and mood.</p>\n\n<p>Hwei expressed this vibrant imagination through paint magic, a medium that influenced the emotions of its audience. As such, it required strict control and discipline, lest it overpower both mental perceptions and bodily sensations. Among its current practitioners, those unable or unwilling to control their art endangered themselves and the community\u2014and were banished from Koyehn.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these precepts, young Hwei indulged his imagination. In a demonstration for the temple masters, he recreated Koyehn\u2019s sea. As paint flowed around the canvas, however, his control ebbed. Emotion crashed through him, wild and fathomless as an ocean, and he surrendered himself to its beauty. His vision turned black, his last memory the awestruck masters, drowning.</p>\n\n<p>Hwei awoke days later, surrounded by his masters\u2014alive, but infuriated. They would not exile the temple\u2019s heir, but they stressed his responsibilities. Hwei was horrified\u2014but fascinated\u2014by the depths of his power, and he craved to see more.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, by day, he upheld Koyehn\u2019s conventions. But alone at night, he pushed the boundaries, driven to explore the extent of his power. In time, this practice focused the intensity of Hwei\u2019s imagination, allowing him to manifest a palette that flowed with magical paint.</p>\n\n<p>Well into adulthood, Hwei mastered his craft. And with passion and humility, he prepared to inherit his birthright, surrounded by the respect and affection of his peers. But part of his mind remained forever shrouded at nightfall.</p>\n\n<p>And so it remained, until the temple received a visiting artist: Khada Jhin.</p>\n\n<p>Over a gilded summer, Hwei accompanied Jhin, guiding him around Koyehn. They often exchanged their creative perspectives, and, respecting their differences, Hwei recognized Jhin\u2019s virtuosity and valued their time together.</p>\n\n<p>But the night before Jhin\u2019s departure, the man challenged Hwei. Jhin sensed that the pieces Hwei showed others were forced fa\u00e7ades\u2014and he wanted to see a real performance. Hwei tried to deny it, but his eyes betrayed him. Flooded by the years spent creating meaningless art, his imagination begged catharsis.</p>\n\n<p>So Hwei painted. Decades of practice guided his brush. The night came alive, colored by the brilliant infinity of his mind. Emotions washed over him, harmonious and visceral, and Hwei welcomed them. Sharing these forbidden visions for another exhilarated him and illuminated the powers of his art: connection, inspiration, and unfettered creation.</p>\n\n<p>Jhin witnessed all. Afterward, with eyes alight and tone inscrutable, he said farewell, stating he would be moving on tomorrow \u201cto watch the lotuses bloom.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At dawn, Hwei and his fellow artists awoke to a series of tragedies.</p>\n\n<p>First: four historic paintings, destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Second: an arrangement of four bodies\u2014the masters that Hwei had almost killed in his youth.</p>\n\n<p>Third: the fiery eruption of the temple\u2019s four lowest floors.</p>\n\n<p>Amid the flames, Hwei imagined the air electric with color. Everything that lived within him bled outward.</p>\n\n<p>It was terrifying. It was beautiful. It was... art. Realizing its dark potential\u2014of destruction, devastation, and torment\u2014Hwei felt the same horror and fascination he had in his youth.</p>\n\n<p>The temple quickly collapsed into ruins, with Hwei emerging as its only survivor.</p>\n\n<p>Exhausted and guilt-ridden, he mourned. Yet his imagination overflowed, reliving every moment of the disaster.</p>\n\n<p>During the day, Hwei and the villagers from the mill town held burials. At night, he revisited the ashen-gray wreckage and painted, his palette taking the shape of Koyehn\u2019s crest\u2014the same worn over his heart.</p>\n\n<p>On one such night, Hwei found the remnants of a trap beneath the rubble\u2014one petaled like a lotus flower.</p>\n\n<p>Realizing who\u2019d wreaked this havoc, a cascade of emotions engulfed Hwei.

As the prophet of the Great Kraken, she uses a huge, golden idol to rip her foes&#x2019; spirits from their bodies and shatter their perception of reality. All who challenge the \u201cTruth Bearer of Nagakabouros\u201d soon discover&#xA0;Illaoi&#xA0;never battles alone - the god of the Serpent Isles fights by her side.</p><p>All who encounter Illaoi are struck by her presence. An intense woman, the priestess is fully committed to the experience of living. She takes what she wants, destroys what she hates, and revels in everything she loves.</p><p>However, to truly know Illaoi you must understand the religion she has devoted her life to. Nagakabouros, the deity of her faith, is usually depicted as an enormous serpent head with tentacles spiraling around it in endless motion, with no beginning and no end. Also called The Mother Serpent, The Great Kraken, or even The Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros is the Serpent Isles&#x2019; god of life, ocean storms, and motion. (The literal translation of its name is \u201cthe unending monster that drives the sea and sky.\u201d) Central to the religion&#x2019;s theology are three tenets: every spirit was born to serve the universe; desire was built into every living being by the universe; the universe only moves toward its destiny when living creatures chase their desires.</p><p>Lesser priestesses are tasked with maintaining temples, calling holy serpents, and teaching people the ways of Nagakabouros. As the religion&#x2019;s Truth Bearer, Illaoi&#x2019;s role is to serve the god directly by unblocking the flow of the universe. To this end, she has two sacred responsibilities.</p><p>The first duty of a Truth Bearer is to be the spearhead in the war against undeath. Having fallen outside of the normal flow of the universe, the undead are considered an abomination against Nagakabouros. While it is the responsibility of every priestess of the Kraken to protect the indigenous population from the Harrowing, a Truth Bearer directly engages its most powerful spirits and drives the Black Mist back.</p><p>Second, Illaoi is tasked with seeking out individuals of great potential and challenging them with the Test of Nagakabouros. This task is the burden Illaoi&#x2019;s title reflects. With her massive, holy relic, The Eye of God, the Truth Bearer strips the subject&#x2019;s spirit from their body then forces them to stand against her to prove their worth. She does this knowing those who fail will be completely annihilated, for the great Kraken has no tolerance for cowardice, doubt, or restraint. But destruction is never the goal. Survivors of the ordeal are forever changed and often find the will to pursue their true destiny.</p><p>Though Illaoi is the most powerful and respected Truth Bearer in a hundred generations, it is where she has broken the traditions of her faith that speaks the most about her. Having completed her training as a Truth Bearer, and at the height of her power, Illaoi left the golden temples of Buhru for the squalor of nearby Bilgewater.</p><p>The pirate city is the only place foreigners are permitted on the Serpent Isles, viewed as a fetid gutter by Illaoi&#x2019;s people. Previous Truth Bearers ignored the city and viewed the arriving foreigners as little better than untouchables. Illaoi broke with tradition when she chose to protect residents of Bilgewater from the Harrowing, or even more controversially when she decided that some of its residents had souls worthy of the great test. Despite this, only a handful of temples have been opened in the city, and very few <em>paylangi </em>(islander slang for residents of mainlander descent) have ever been permitted inside. Regardless, it is Illaoi who has brought the widespread awareness of the Mother Serpent to Bilgewater, and it is her indomitable spirit that has brought her religion into favor there.</p><p>Rumors persist that Bilgewater&#x2019;s most bloodthirsty and infamous pirate had his heart broken by the towering priestess. To anyone who has ever met her, this is no surprise. Illaoi&#x2019;s rough manner belies subtle intelligence, strength, and a magnetic confidence.</p><p>Many seek Illaoi&#x2019;s favor and welcome her to Bilgewater... yet everyone fears being tested by the Kraken&#x2019;s Prophet.</p><p><em>\u201cThere can be no rest. We are the motion.\u201d</em></p><p>&#x2014;From <em>The Twenty Wisdoms of Nagakabouros</em></p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Even as a small child, Xan Irelia was fascinated by the grace and beauty of human movement. Under her grandmother\u2019s tutelage, she learned the traditional silk dances of her province\u2014though she was dubious of their supposedly mystical connection to the Spirit of Ionia, Irelia\u2019s love for the dances was real. Seeking to master the art, she eventually left home to study with some of Ionia\u2019s most respected performers at the Placidium of Navori.</p><p>Irelia\u2019s people were peaceful and sought harmony with their neighbors, but rumors of foreign invaders sighted off the coast unsettled many at the Placidium. Irelia returned to her village to find it already occupied, with steel-helmed soldiers from distant Noxus shoving unarmed civilians through the streets with the butts of their spears. The Noxian Admiral Duqal had seized the Xan home to quarter his fleet officers.</p><p>Irelia\u2019s brothers and her father Lito had evidently protested; her entire family now lay in unmarked graves, in the gardens.</p><p>Ravaged by grief, the young girl saw Duqal\u2019s men hauling valuables from the house. Among the loot was a large metal crest, depicting the Xan family emblem. Irelia raced to it, wrenching it from Noxian hands. The admiral himself hurled her to the ground, and had his warriors shatter the crest with a heavy iron maul, before ordering them to dig a fresh grave for this upstart child.</p><p>As they surrounded her, Irelia averted her eyes, looking to the pieces of the Xan crest scattered on the ground. From deep within her soul, she felt a strange rhythm begin to beat. The shards of metal began to twitch, to twist, moving seemingly on their own, and Irelia felt the serene joy of the ancient dances once more...</p><p>With a sweep of her arm, she sent the pieces flying like ragged blades, cutting clean through two of the Noxians. As Duqal and his officers reeled in shock, Irelia snatched up the shards of her crest, and fled the village.</p><p>In the quiet forests beyond, Irelia mourned her family, and thought back to her grandmother\u2019s teachings. She realized that the techniques she had learned were more than mere dances\u2014they were a powerful expression of something far greater.</p><p>The Noxian occupation soon began to test the fragile peace of the First Lands. It was said that even the religious leader Karma had been forced to strike back at the invaders with deadly magic, though her followers had now withdrawn to the Lasting Altar and would not condone any further violence. Across Navori, dissenting voices began to band together. A resistance was forming, one that would not rest until Ionia was free once more. Irelia joined their ranks, performing her cherished dances for them in the woodland camps, to preserve some vestige of their vanishing culture.</p><p>She was barely fourteen years old when she found herself back at the Placidium. Her band of resistance fighters joined the militia who had sworn to guard the monasteries and wild, sacred gardens.</p><p>But Noxus knew only too well what this place represented. A particularly cunning general named Jericho Swain captured the Placidium and took its defenders hostage, hoping to lure the inevitable reinforcements into a trap.</p><p>It was in this moment that Irelia rose to meet her destiny. Freed from her bonds, she unleashed the full potential of her ancient blade dance, lashing out with graceful zeal. A dozen of Swain\u2019s veterans fell, sowing chaos in their ranks as the other captives joined her, before she struck down the general himself\u2014the sight of this rebellious girl hefting his severed arm over her head would be the turning point of the war.</p><p>This victory, the Great Stand at Navori, ensured that everyone in Ionia knew the name of Xan Irelia, and looked to her for leadership. Reluctantly, she led the growing resistance for almost three years of grueling battle before her triumph at Dalu Bay. There, she finally cornered the defeated Admiral Duqal, and exacted the vengeance she had sought for so long.</p><p>Though the war has long since ended, Ionia has been permanently changed by it. The First Lands are now divided, with rival factions fighting each other almost as bitterly as they did the Noxians. Many continue to look to Irelia for answers but, while others might welcome such power, Irelia remains uneasy with it.</p><p>At heart, she still yearns only to dance alone.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Ivern the Cruel was renowned as a fierce warrior, in the latter days of the ancient Vorrijaard. His clan followed the most warlike of the old gods, and would not kneel before the upstart \u201cThree Sisters\u201d like so many others had.</p><p>However, the dark sorcery that strengthened their armies was undeniable. Ivern and his kin plotted long and hard to overthrow these hated Iceborn, eventually setting sail into the east\u2014in search of the land where the sun first rose, from where it was said that all magic flowed into the world. If Ivern could seize such power for his own, then he could surely break any foe.</p><p>As his fleet sailed over the horizon, they passed out of memory and into myth, for they were never seen in their homeland again.</p><p>In truth, Ivern the Cruel landed on the shores of Ionia. After cleaving through a dozen coastal settlements, he and his warriors discovered a sacred grove known as <i>Omikayalan</i>, \u201cthe Heart of the World\u201d. And there, in that strange and verdant garden, they met the fiercest resistance. Chimeric beings\u2014half human, half beast\u2014came at them again and again beneath the twisted branches.</p><p>Undeterred, Ivern pressed on, until the battered remnants of his expedition reached what the Ionians held so sacred: the legendary God-Willow.</p><p>Ivern was transfixed, even as the fighting raged around him. It was a truly <i>colossal</i> tree, dripping with long gossamer leaves that shimmered with golden-green light. It was magic like nothing he had ever felt before, and it was clear these inhuman creatures would die to protect it. Seeking to shatter their resolve, he took up his war axe, and roared with hatred as he struck at the God-Willow over and over again.</p><p>The great tree fell. In a riot of life-energy, Ivern the Cruel was instantly undone.</p><p>Detached, drifting, he saw the battle was over. The flesh of the fallen fed carrion birds and insects alike, or decayed under bursts of colorful mushrooms. Bones rotted into fertile soil, and seeds within it budded and sprouted into trees bearing fruit of their own. Leaves and petals pulsed like colorful hearts. From the death that surrounded him, life exploded forth in ways too numerous to believe.</p><p>Never had Ivern beheld such beauty. Life, in all its forms, was tangled together like an impossible knot that didn\u2019t want to be untied. He wept, and those dewdrop tears fell upon his changed body. He was taller than he remembered, his limbs rough with bark and leaves. The magic of an entirely different world coursed through him. He did not know why, or how, but he <i>was</i> all that now remained of the God-Willow.</p><p>With that realization, he heard the bawling of hills, the howling of trees, and the dripping tears of moss. He reflected on the mistakes he\u2019d made, the cruelty he\u2019d visited on others. Remorse washed over Ivern, and he cried out for forgiveness.</p><p>When he finally moved, so much time had passed that the world felt\u2026 new? The violence and sadness of his former self were mere echoes in his heart. He found he could dig his toes deep into the soil, and commune with the roots, rocks, and rivers. Even the dirt itself had opinions!</p><p>Ivern wandered far\u2014across Ionia, and beyond\u2014and the strange magic of Omikayalan followed in his wake. He developed close kinships with creatures great and small, observing their foibles, delighting in their little habits, and occasionally offering a helping hand. He shortened the inchworm\u2019s path, played tricks with mischievous bramblebacks, hugged thorny elmarks, and laughed with wizened elder-fungus.</p><p>In one instance, he found a wounded stone golem. Knowing the poor thing\u2019s spirit was fading, he fashioned her a new heart from a river pebble, and the golem became Ivern\u2019s devoted life-friend. He named her Daisy, after the flowers that mysteriously sprouted from her stone body.</p><p>Sometimes, Ivern encountered mortals, and many of them were at least <i>somewhat</i> peaceful. They called him Bramblefoot, or Green Father, or the Old Woodsman, and told tales of his strange benevolence. But he was filled with sadness to see how they still took more than they gave, how they could be so cruel and so careless, and he retreated from their company.</p><p>If he bore the God-Willow\u2019s legacy, he needed to cultivate humanity\u2014help them watch, listen, and grow. Being mortal once himself, Ivern knew this would be difficult, so he smiled and challenged himself to complete this task before the final sunset.</p><p>He knew he would have time.</p>",

He knows all the secrets of the natural world, and holds deep friendships with things that grow, fly, and scuttle. Ivern enriches the forests, imparts strange wisdom to any mortal he meets, and occasionally entrusts loose-lipped butterflies with his secrets.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Soon after King Jarvan III\u2019s coronation, he addressed the people of Demacia. Even though there were still many foes beyond the borders of their proud kingdom, several of the noble families had begun to feud with one another, some even raising private militias to seek the favor of their new king.</p><p>This would not stand. Jarvan would not allow such dangerous rivalries to develop, and declared his intention to end the feuding by marriage. His bride, the Lady Catherine, was much beloved by the people\u2014and courtly gossip had long held that the two shared some secret fondness for one another. The bells of the Great City rang for a day and a night in celebration, and by year\u2019s end came the announcement that the royal couple were expecting their first son.</p><p>But all joy was forgotten when Catherine died in childbirth.</p><p>The infant, named for his father\u2019s line, was declared heir apparent to the throne of Demacia. Torn between grief and elation, Jarvan III swore never to take another wife, and that all his hopes and dreams for the kingdom\u2019s future would live on in his son.</p><p>With no memory of his mother, the young prince Jarvan was raised at court, groomed and guarded every moment of his life. The king insisted that he receive the finest Demacian education, learning from an early age the moral value of charity, the solemn burden of duty, and the honor of a life spent in service to one\u2019s people. As he grew, he was also introduced to the history and politics of Valoran by his father\u2019s seneschal, Xin Zhao. Hailing from distant Ionia, this loyal protector taught the prince about the world\u2019s more spiritual philosophies, as well as the myriad arts of war.</p><p>During his military training, Prince Jarvan found himself facing a brash youth of the Crownguard family named Garen. The two were of similar age, and became a quick pair\u2014Jarvan admired Garen\u2019s sheer determination and fortitude, and Garen looked up to the prince\u2019s tactical instincts.</p><p>When Jarvan came of age, his father rewarded him with the honorary rank of general. While it was not necessarily expected that the heir to the throne would take to the field of battle, Jarvan was determined to prove himself, with or without the king\u2019s blessing. The lands beyond the Argent Mountains had long been contested by the empire of Noxus, creating an almost lawless frontier where foreign reavers and warring tribes threatened many of Demacia\u2019s allies. The prince pledged to bring stability back to the region. His great grandfather had been slain by a foul Noxian brute many years ago, in the first clashes between their nations in the south. Now, that insult would finally be answered.</p><p>Jarvan\u2019s armies won victory after victory\u2026 but the carnage he witnessed in the outlying towns troubled him deeply. When word came that the Gates of Mourning had fallen, he resolved to drive onward into Noxian territory, against the advice of his lieutenants.</p><p>Inevitably, with the battalions spread so thin, Jarvan was encircled and defeated by Noxian warbands before he even reached Trevale.</p><p>Refusing to surrender, the prince and a handful of other survivors fled into the forests, only to be hounded for days by enemy scouts. Eventually, pierced through his side by an arrow, Jarvan collapsed into the shade of a fallen tree, where he drifted in and out of consciousness. He was devastated. He had failed his family, his kingdom, and his brothers-in-arms.</p><p>Doubtless he would have died there, alone, were it not for Shyvana.</p><p>This strange, violet-skinned woman somehow carried Jarvan all the way back to Demacia, to the old castle at Wrenwall, where she proved herself a kind and worthy companion during his days of healing. At first taken aback by her outlandish appearance, the garrison commander could not deny that she had done a great service to the throne in saving Jarvan\u2019s life.</p><p>Unfortunately, Shyvana was herself being pursued\u2014by the monstrous elemental dragon Yvva. When the castle\u2019s watchmen spotted the beast on the horizon, Jarvan saw a chance to redeem himself. As Shyvana prepared to meet the beast in the skies in her half-dragon form, the prince limped from his bed to marshal the garrison, and reinforce the walls. He took up his lance, and swore that they would return to the Great City with the head of Yvva, or not at all.</p><p>The battle was swift and deadly. When his men were driven in fear from their posts, it was Jarvan who rallied them. When they were wounded, it was Jarvan who directed healers to their aid. The fell creature was slain by Shyvana, but it was the prince\u2019s leadership that had held the line. In that moment, Jarvan saw the true strength of the Demacian people\u2014standing together as one in defense of their homeland, no matter their differences or misgivings. He promised Shyvana that she would always have a place among his guard, if she so chose.</p><p>With the dragon\u2019s skull in tow, Jarvan journeyed to his father\u2019s court in triumph, Shyvana at his side. Though the king was overcome with emotion at his son\u2019s return, some of the gathered nobles quietly questioned the wisdom of allowing such a creature to stand with the prince\u2026 let alone serve as one of his protectors.</p><p>Even so, Jarvan resumed his position within the military, also playing a key role in stately matters beyond the defense of the realm. With his friend Garen now Sword-Captain of the elite Dauntless Vanguard, and Shyvana and the Wrenwall veterans training other border garrisons, the prince felt assured that Demacia could answer any emergent threat.</p><p>But the kingdom itself was changing.</p><p>The Mageseeker order had gained support among the noble families, leading to widespread imprisonment of anyone in Demacia possessing magical talents. Fear of persecution quickly gave way to resentment, and finally rebellion. When mages attacked the Great City, Jarvan was distraught to discover that his father, the king, had been killed.</p><p>Although the prince\u2019s political stance toward mages has hardened significantly since then, he has yet to fully allay concerns over his suitability to rule. As such, he has taken the counsel of many prominent nobles\u2014including Garen\u2019s aunt, High Marshal Tianna Crownguard\u2014and pledged to heed their wisdom and experience in the days ahead.</p><p>For he must examine his own conscience and allegiances carefully if he is ever to come into his inheritance, and be crowned King Jarvan IV of Demacia.</p>",

Raised to be a paragon of his nation\u2019s greatest virtues, he is forced to balance the heavy expectations placed upon him with his own desire to prove himself on the battlefield. An exceptional warrior in his own right, Jarvan also inspires his troops with fearsome courage and selfless determination, raising his family\u2019s colors high and revealing his true strength as a future leader of his people.",

From sailors seeking good weather to the downtrodden calling on winds of change, mortals have placed their hope in the tempests and gales that sweep across Runeterra.</p><p>Surprisingly, the wind sometimes would seem to answer. Seafarers might spot a bright blue bird just before a healthy tailwind billowed their sails. Others could swear they\u2019d heard a whistling in the air right before a storm, as if to warn them of its approach. As word of these omens spread, sightings of the bird grew more common. Some even swore they had seen the bird transform into a woman. With tapered ears and flowing hair, this mysterious maiden was said to float above the water and direct the wind with a flick of her staff.</p><p>The faithful called this wind spirit <i>Jan\u2019ahrem</i>, an ancient Shuriman word meaning \u201cguardian,\u201d for she always seemed to appear in moments of great need. As time went on, she came to be known more simply as Janna.</p><p>Her name spread across the Shuriman continent\u2019s coasts, and the seafaring people of Oshra Va\u2019Zaun were her most fervent believers. They depended on calm seas for the trade ships that traveled through their city\u2019s port. Statues and shrines were raised in gratitude for Janna\u2019s benevolence. After the Shuriman empire enveloped the city, these displays of devotion continued\u2026 for a time.</p><p>When the emperor issued decrees suppressing \u201cfalse idols,\u201d Janna\u2019s statues were torn down. Yet despite the growing worship of the Ascended god-warriors, many still offered quiet prayers to Janna, for what could god-warriors do to protect ships from storms? These mortals often wore amulets with the image of a bluebird\u2014smaller, more personal tokens in Janna\u2019s honor.</p><p>Through all of this, Janna continued to aid the vulnerable who called upon her. In a region rife with upheaval, she remained constant. Those with an eye toward history might appreciate the irony of \u201cwinds of change\u201d being the only thing that did <i>not</i>.</p><p>After the great empire fell, once verdant lands became a desert as the remaining Ascended brought war and chaos\u2014yet Janna shielded the city, now known as Zaun, from the turmoil.</p><p>Over the centuries, Janna watched as Zaun\u2019s ambitions grew. While the city was still a robust trade port, its denizens aspired for more. They dreamed of cutting a canal through the isthmus on which they lived, opening a path that would unite the seas surrounding Valoran and Shurima. The city poured great effort, wealth, and time into the construction. Prayers to Janna waned as mortal dreams focused on mortal machinations.</p><p>However, the canal\u2019s excavation made great portions of Zaun unstable. On one cataclysmic day, entire districts on the River Pilt collapsed below the western sea level, and thousands suddenly found themselves fighting for their lives against the clashing currents.</p><p>As these unfortunate souls faced their doom, they prayed for salvation. They called out the name of their ancient protector:</p><p>Janna.</p><p>Though these mortals had seemingly forgotten her until now, Janna did not hesitate to help them. An immense gale swept over the city as she took corporeal form. Impossible walls of air held flooding waters at bay as people fled the drowned ruins of their homes. Ferocious gusts of wind cut through the suffocating smoke from fires caused by the destruction. Yet while she saved many, thousands still perished that day\u2014but all who survived witnessed Janna\u2019s benevolence. Never again would the city\u2019s people forget their savior.</p><p>To this day, through the rise of Piltover and the ongoing struggles of modern Zaun, Janna\u2019s faithful wear bluebird medallions and show reverence to the winds. And through it all, Janna stands steadfast by the humble and the meek. Zaunites all know that whether they fight for breath amid the toxic clouds of the Zaun Gray, stand against the brutality of violent chem-barons, or fend off other threats, Janna will not abandon them.</p>",

Ever since he was a boy, his father told him of when their home was a proud, independent nation, before it was ground under the heel of Shuriman oppression. He told him of the Kohari, heroes who protected Icathia and its Mage King. The Mage King had resisted Shurima\u2019s conquest, but when he died in battle, his Kohari protectors followed him, committing ritual suicide. The Shuriman emperor displayed the Kohari\u2019s decaying bodies for all to see, and the Mage King himself was impaled above the city gates, his bones left to molder.</p>\n<p>Saijax\u2019s father had witnessed this cruel act, and over time he passed down to his son the burning resentment that was growing in every Icathian heart. Even so, Saijax committed himself to the study of arms, learning from Shurima\u2019s weapons masters as well as his own clan\u2019s elders.</p>\n<p>After many centuries of Shuriman rule, a massive earthquake struck the coastal province of Saabera. The destruction revealed something hidden deep beneath the earth, something dark and of great power\u2014perhaps strong enough even to overcome Shurima\u2019s god-like Ascended warriors. Saijax was entrusted with protecting the Icathian mages who encountered this discovery\u2026 which the guards just barely contained with brazier-staves that blazed with conjured elemental fire. Disturbed, he escorted the mages to the governing council so they could tell of what they\u2019d learned.</p>\n<p>They called this power the Void.</p>\n<p>Immediately the council recognized its potential, but Saijax saw the doom the Void portended. As a master of weaponry, he knew the danger of using a weapon they could neither fully understand nor safely harness. He regretted that he didn\u2019t kill the mages as they rode from Saabera. He would regret it even more in the days to come.</p>\n<p>Confident that the Void could defeat their Shuriman overlords, the council crowned a new Mage King. The Kohari were rebuilt, with Saijax among the first to join their ranks. They triumphed in early engagements, and Saijax even killed one of the vaunted Ascended in battle, watching with pride as its corpse was paraded around the liberated city of Bai-Zhek.</p>\n<p>When the Ascended Host approached Icathia, Saijax and his brethren assembled on the front lines. As the two armies churned the earth beneath them into crimson loam, Icathia\u2019s mages and priests deemed the time had come to unleash the Void.</p>\n<p>Ruin swept over the land, as Icathians, Shurimans, and even Ascended were unraveled from existence. The city\u2019s walls collapsed as the Void swallowed thousands into cold, silent oblivion.</p>\n<p>In moments, Icathia was lost.</p>\n<p>Saijax rode to the ruined crater where the Void had been summoned, determined to fall upon his sword like the Kohari of old. But before he could take his life, he saw among the devastation a discarded brazier-stave that he recognized from Saabera\u2014it still blazed with elemental fire that harmed the Void. This flame kindled a spark in Saijax\u2019s heart. He took up the stave and left behind the ruins of his homeland, tending to this \u201clast light of Icathia\u201d, and the hope it represented.</p>\n<p>Grieving and ashamed, Saijax Cail-Rynx Kohari Icath\u2019un forsook his old name, and from that day was known only as Jax.</p>\n<p>He became a wanderer, traveling across the known world and to places beyond any map. As he bore the elemental fire, Jax\u2019s life extended beyond even the expectations of his long-lived people. Yet the farther he went from Icathia, the lower the flame burned, until it threatened to gutter out once and for all. Jax understood with grim resolution that he couldn\u2019t run from his past. He had a duty to return, and fight. The advance of the Void had been halted by the last surviving Ascended, but its singular threat endured.</p>\n<p>For centuries since, Jax has roamed, a vagabond warrior searching for those strong enough to rebuild the Kohari. Though he has fought countless times against beings of great skill, courage, and power, none have yet convinced him that they can march against the coming darkness. The fall of Icathia has plagued Jax with doubt, but one thing remains certain: when the final battle comes, Jax will stand against the Void.</p>\n<p>Even if he has to face it alone.</p>",

He gathered the \u201clast light of Icathia\u201d, a symbol of his hope to one day defeat the Void, and now travels the world, searching for warriors strong enough to face the coming darkness by his side.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Jayce is a brilliant inventor who has pledged his life to the defense of Piltover and its unyielding pursuit of progress. With his transforming hextech hammer in hand, Jayce uses his strength, courage, and considerable intelligence to protect his hometown. While revered throughout the city as a hero, he hasn\u2019t taken well to the attention it brings. Still, Jayce\u2019s heart is in the right place, and even those who envy his natural skills are grateful for his protection in the City of Progress.</p><p>A native son of Piltover, Jayce was raised to believe in the principles that made the city great: Invention. Discovery. Not going to Zaun if you could help it. With a knack for understanding machinery, Jayce earned the honor of being the youngest apprenta to ever be offered patronage by Clan Giopara, one of Piltover\u2019s most respected ruling clans. Utterly unsurprised, Jayce took the offer, and spent most of his early years constructing potential hextech devices and designing transformable multi-tools for Piltover\u2019s working class: a wrench that transformed into a prybar, a pickaxe that could morph into a shovel, a hammer that could turn into a demolition beam, if only it had a sufficiently powerful battery. Everything Jayce touched put his contemporaries to shame.</p><p>Most things came easy to Jayce, and he could never understand why his peers had so much trouble with what, to him, were simple concepts. As a result, nearly everyone who worked alongside Jayce found him arrogant, dismissive, and unwilling to slow his pace to help his colleagues catch up. As time went on, his patience became shorter, while at the same time, a chasm grew between decorum, charm, and Jayce\u2019s natural demeanor.</p><p>Only one person ever managed to match Jayce\u2019s intelligence while also maintaining a healthy indifference to his superior attitude.</p><p>His name was Viktor.</p><p>The two met at a mandatory Progress Day party, and immediately bonded over how little either of them wanted to be there. They started working together shortly after. Viktor expanded Jayce\u2019s intellectual horizons and challenged many of his assumptions. While Jayce sought to improve humanity via versatile technology, Viktor sought to solve problems inherent to humanity itself, such as physical decay or illogical prejudices. They constantly argued with one another, but their conflicts never got personal \u2013 though their methods were different, the two colleagues knew their ultimate goals were very much the same. More than that, they both knew what it was like to be ostracized by their colleagues: Viktor because of his unconventional thinking, Jayce because of his rudeness.</p><p>Together, Jayce and Viktor invented a mechanized construction suit for Piltover\u2019s dockworkers \u2013 something hearty enough to enhance the wearer\u2019s strength, but light enough that its wearer wouldn\u2019t immediately drown upon falling overboard. However, the two reached an impasse when Viktor\u2019s design for the next version of the suit included a chemtech implant that would increase the wearer\u2019s strength output by tenfold, while also preventing them from getting tired, panicking, or disobeying instructions from their superiors. While Viktor considered this feature a brilliant means of reducing the frequency of construction accidents, Jayce found its indifference toward free will immoral. The two nearly came to blows over the design and ultimately, after Jayce warned the academy of Viktor\u2019s invention, Viktor was stripped of his honors and ostracized from Piltover\u2019s scientific community. </p><p>Viktor was the closest thing Jayce had ever really had to a friend, and distraught over their falling-out, went back to working on his own. He grew more insular. His patience toward others grew even thinner.</p><p>As Jayce studied in solitude, Clan Giopara\u2019s explorers discovered a raw, blue crystal deep within the Shuriman desert. Though Jayce volunteered to experiment on it (specifically by suggesting the clan\u2019s other scholars wouldn\u2019t be smart enough to get anything out of it), his lack of tact in doing so prompted Clan Giopara to give it to their better-mannered scholars as a form of punishment. Yet, after many months, the scholars reached a unanimous conclusion: the crystal was worthless. A power-drained hunk of rock. The disappointed clan leaders finally handed the crystal over to Jayce, assuming that even he, with his remarkable intelligence, wouldn\u2019t be able to learn anything from it.</p><p>Something inside the crystal called to Jayce. No, more than that \u2013 it sang to him. He couldn\u2019t explain why, but he knew the Shuriman gem still held mysteries yet to be discovered.</p><p>He spent many months running every variety of test on the crystal. He braced it into a cogwheel centrifuge; he superheated it and deep-froze it; he tinkered, and observed, and hypothesized, and beat his head against his copper pantograph. Quite simply, Jayce wasn\u2019t used to working hard: this damned crystal was the first thing that had ever resisted his considerable mental aptitude. For the first time, he realized how his peers must have felt, trying so hard to solve a problem, only to bump against your own limitations. It felt frustrating. It felt unfair. </p><p>And it probably felt much, much worse if you were working alongside an arrogant inventor who dismissed your every effort. </p><p>Jayce realized that despite how dismissive he\u2019d been toward his fellow scholars, none of them ever gave up. None of them ever stopped seeking the very things that defined Piltover: Progress. Discovery. If they wouldn\u2019t give up, Jayce decided, he wouldn\u2019t either. </p><p>And maybe he\u2019d try to be nicer. </p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Jayce approached the problem from a completely different angle. Rather than trying to experiment on the crystal as a whole, he wondered, why not run more invasive experiments on a smaller shard? Jayce chiseled off a piece of the crystal and suspended it in a liquid alloy. As he sent a voltaic current through the liquid metal, Jayce\u2019s eardrums nearly shattered from the booming baritone note that blasted from the shard. Heat radiated from the crystal and, with a flash, it glowed bright enough to nearly blind him. This was unexpected. This was potentially dangerous. But this was progress. Jayce couldn\u2019t erase the smile from his face as he worked well through the night, into the dawn. </p><p>The next day, Jayce was surprised to find his old friend Viktor on his doorstep. Alerted by the massive power spike from the crystal shard, Viktor had a simple proposition.</p><p>Since his expulsion from the Piltovan scientific community, Viktor had commenced work on a secret project in Zaun. He\u2019d finally learned how to achieve his dream \u2013 how to eradicate disease, hunger, hatred. If Jayce joined him, the two would accomplish more than anyone from Piltover or Zaun could have dreamed of: they\u2019d save humanity from itself. </p><p>Jayce had heard a monologue like this before from Viktor. He never liked where it led.</p><p>Viktor told Jayce that he only needed one thing for his Glorious Evolution \u2013 a power source like Jayce\u2019s crystal. Jayce disagreed, informing Viktor that what he truly needed was a moral compass. Viktor, who had long grown tired of Jayce\u2019s rudeness, leapt upon him, grabbed the crystal and knocked Jayce unconscious with it. When Jayce awoke hours later, he noticed that though the Shuriman crystal was gone Viktor hadn\u2019t seemed to notice or care about the smaller shard.</p><p>Jayce knew whatever Viktor was planning, he would only resort to these measures if he were close to completion. Even though he didn\u2019t know what Viktor\u2019s Glorious Evolution consisted of, it probably didn\u2019t have a lot of respect for the free will of others. Without wasting a second, Jayce retrieved the suspended shard and installed it into a massive, transforming hammer \u2013 a demolitions invention he\u2019d abandoned years ago for lack of a strong enough battery to power it. Though he had no idea where Viktor might have taken the crystal, he could feel the hextech hammer vibrate, pulling him not north, south, east or west, but down, toward the undercity of Zaun.</p><p>The shard, eager to be reunited with the crystal from which it was chiseled, eventually led Jayce to a warehouse in the depths of the sump. Within the cavernous building, Jayce found something horrifying. Dozens of corpses, their skulls sawed open and hollowed out, their brains transplanted into an army of immobile metal soldiers, hooked up to the now-pulsing crystal. </p><p>This was the first step in Viktor\u2019s Glorious Evolution.</p><p>Jayce\u2019s stride grew less confident as he approached Viktor. He and Viktor had not always seen eye to eye, but this was something else entirely. For the first time, it occurred to Jayce that he might have to kill his old friend.</p><p>He called out to Viktor, flinching as the army of robots stood to attention. Jayce asked him to look around \u2013 to see what he was doing. Whatever this was \u2013 this Evolution \u2013 wasn\u2019t the progress they fought for in their youths. He even, to Viktor\u2019s surprise, apologized for acting like such a jerk. </p><p>Viktor sighed. He had only two words in response: \u201cKill him.\u201d</p><p>The automatons sprinted toward Jayce, breaking free of the wires connecting them to the crystal and introducing Jayce to another new emotion: panic. He gripped the hammer tight, realizing he\u2019d never actually used it before. When the first golem was within reach, he swung as hard as he could, feeling the shard\u2019s energy surge through his muscles, accelerating the hammer\u2019s movement until Jayce was worried it might fly out of his hands.</p><p>It slammed into the automaton, all but exploding it into a hail of metal. Despite the obliteration of their comrade, the other machines didn\u2019t even pause as they rushed at Jayce, trying to pummel him into unconsciousness.</p><p>Jayce analyzed the formation of the mechanical wave coming at him and attempted to quickly calculate how to take out the largest number of them with the fewest amount of swings. It was pointless; they were on him before he could swing even once. As he fell to the ground under a storm of their blows, Jayce saw Viktor looking on, not with triumph, but with sadness. He\u2019d outsmarted Jayce and ensured humanity\u2019s future, but he knew that future came at a cost: he couldn\u2019t let his old friend live. Jayce vanished under a sea of swinging metal limbs.</p><p>That\u2019s when Jayce, for the first time in his life, decided to stop thinking and just break stuff.</p><p>No longer caring for his own safety, Jayce used every last bit of strength he had to break free from Viktor\u2019s automatons. He sprinted to the glowing crystal, and struck it with all of the hextech-enhanced force his hammer could muster, crushing the mystical object.</p><p>Viktor cried out in horror as the crystal shattered to fragments, the shockwave blasting them all backward as the army of automatons collapsed lifelessly to the floor. The very foundations of the warehouse shook, and Jayce barely managed to escape before the entire building toppled. </p><p>Viktor\u2019s body was never found.</p><p>Upon his return to Piltover, Jayce informed his clan masters of Viktor\u2019s nefarious plans. Soon, Jayce found himself a topic of discussion in both Zaun and Piltover alike. Hailed for his quick thinking in a time of crisis, Jayce became a beloved figure (at least, amongst those who hadn\u2019t met him), earning himself a nickname: the Defender of Tomorrow.</p><p>Jayce cared little for the adoration of his fellow Piltovans, but took the nickname to heart. He knew that Viktor was still out there, plotting his revenge. One day \u2013 maybe someday soon \u2013 an awful lot of trouble was headed for Piltover.</p><p>And Jayce would be waiting. </p>",

Depicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the cruel spirit\u2019s banishment is still celebrated to this day.</p>\n<p>But at the heart of every myth there lies a kernel of truth, and the truth of the Golden Demon is one far different than the fiction.</p>\n<p>For years, Ionia\u2019s southern mountains were plagued by the infamous creature. Throughout the province of Zhyun, and even as far as Shon-Xan and Galrin, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses. Armed militias searched the forests, towns hired demon hunters, Wuju masters patrolled the roads\u2014but nothing slowed the beast\u2019s grisly work.</p>\n<p>In desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho of the Kinkou Order for help. Charged with maintaining the balance between the spirit and material realms, Kusho was adept in the banishment of demons. Leaving in secret lest the cunning creature be alerted to their intent, Kusho, his teenage son, Shen, and young apprentice, Zed, traveled to the province. They tended to countless families shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for connections between the murders. Soon, Kusho realized they were far from the first to hunt this killer, and his conviction grew that this was the work of something beyond the demonic.</p>\n<p>For the next four years, the Golden Demon remained beyond their reach, and the long investigation left the three men changed. The famous red mane of Kusho turned white; Shen, known for his wit and humor, became somber; and Zed, the brightest star of Kusho\u2019s temple, began to struggle with his studies. It was almost as though the demon knew they were seeking it, and delighted in the torment sown by their failure.</p>\n<p>Upon finally finding a pattern to the killings, the Great Master is quoted as saying: \u201cGood and evil are not truths. They are born from men, and each sees the shades differently.\u201d Kusho sought to hand off the investigation, believing now that they sought not a demon, but a wicked human or vastaya, taking them beyond the Kinkou\u2019s mandate. Shen and Zed, unwilling to turn back after all they had sacrificed to bring the killer within reach, convinced him to continue the hunt.</p>\n<p>On the eve of the Spirit Blossom Festival in Jyom Pass, Kusho disguised himself as a renowned calligrapher to blend in with the other guest artists. Then he waited. Shen and Zed laid a carefully prepared trap, and at long last, they found themselves face to face with their hated quarry. Kusho was proven right\u2014the famed \u201cGolden Demon\u201d was a mere stagehand in Zhyun\u2019s traveling theaters and opera houses, working under the name Khada Jhin.</p>\n<p>After they caught Jhin, young Zed made to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back. He reminded his students that they had already broken their remit, and that killing Jhin would only worsen matters. Kusho worried that knowledge of Jhin\u2019s humanity would undermine the harmony and trust that defined Ionian culture, or could even encourage others to commit similar crimes. Despite Jhin\u2019s actions, the legendary master decided the killer should be taken alive and locked away within the monastery prison at Tuula.</p>\n<p>Shen disagreed, but submitted to the emotionless logic of his father\u2019s judgment. Zed, disturbed and haunted by the horrors he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.</p>\n<p>Imprisoned in Tuula, Jhin kept his secrets, revealing little of himself as many years went by. The monks guarding him noted he was a bright student who excelled in many subjects, including smithing, poetry, and dance. Regardless, they could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations. Meanwhile, outside the monastery\u2019s walls, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire invaded, and war awoke the tranquil nation\u2019s appetite for bloodshed.</p>\n<p>Jhin was freed from Tuula sometime after the war with Noxus, possibly put to use by one of the many radical elements vying for power of the First Lands near the conflict\u2019s end. He now has access to the Kashuri armories\u2019 new weapons, though how he came to possess such implements of destruction, and what connection he has to Kashuri, is still a mystery.</p>\n<p>Whoever his shadowy patrons might be, they have endowed Jhin with nearly unlimited funds, and seem unconcerned by the growing scale of his \u201cperformances\u201d. Recently, he attacked members of Zed\u2019s Yanlei order, and mass murders and assassinations bearing his signature \u201cflair\u201d have occurred not only across Ionia\u2019s many regions, but also in distant Piltover and Zaun.</p>\n<p>It seems that all of Runeterra might be but a canvas for the atrocity that is Khada Jhin\u2019s art, and only he knows where the next brushstroke will fall.</p>",

No one knows for certain what happened to turn that sweet young child into a wildcard, infamous for her wanton acts of destruction. But once Jinx exploded onto the scene in Piltover, her unique talent for sowing anarchy instantly became the stuff of legend.</p>\n<p>Jinx first gained notoriety through her anonymous \u201cpranks\u201d on the citizens of Piltover\u2026 particularly those with connections to the wealthy merchant clans. These pranks ranged from the moderately annoying to the criminally dangerous. She blocked streets on Progress Day, with a stampede of exotic animals freed from Count Mei\u2019s menagerie. She disrupted trade for weeks when she lined the city\u2019s iconic bridges with adorably destructive flame chompers. Once, she even managed to move every street sign in town to new and utterly confusing locations.</p>\n<p>Though this unknown troublemaker\u2019s targets seemed random, and her motivation nothing more than pure chaos, her actions always served to bring the city\u2019s orderly bustle to a screeching halt.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the wardens attributed some of her crimes to chem-punk gangs from the undercity. Having others get credit for her manic schemes didn\u2019t sit well with Jinx, and so she made sure to make her presence known at every future crime scene. Rumors soon circulated of the mysterious, blue-haired Zaunite girl carrying chemtech explosives, a shark-mouthed rocket launcher, and a repeater gun. Still, the authorities dismissed these reports as preposterous. After all, how could a lowly street punk possibly obtain such lethal ordnance?</p>\n<p>Jinx\u2019s bombastic spree seemed endless, with the wardens\u2019 attempts to catch the culprit thwarted at every turn. She began tagging her works of destruction with vivid graffiti, and other taunting messages directed at the city sheriff\u2019s newest ally in the fight against crime, Enforcer Vi.</p>\n<p>Jinx\u2019s reputation grew, leaving the people of Zaun divided as to whether she was a hero for sticking it to the arrogant Pilties, or a dangerous lunatic for escalating existing tensions between their two cities.</p>\n<p>After months of ever-increasing carnage, Jinx unveiled her biggest plan yet. In her trademark electric pink, Jinx daubed the walls of the Ecliptic Vaults\u2014one of Piltover\u2019s most secure treasuries\u2014with a <em>very</em> unflattering caricature of Enforcer Vi, and the details of her own intention to rob the stores within.</p>\n<p>An uneasy sense of anticipation settled on Piltover and Zaun leading up to the promised date of the heist. Many doubted even Jinx would have the guts to show up and risk almost certain capture.</p>\n<p>When the day arrived, Vi, Sheriff Caitlyn, and the wardens prepared a trap for Jinx outside the treasury. But Jinx had already smuggled herself inside by way of an oversized coin crate that had been delivered days before. When Vi heard pandemonium erupt from inside the structure, she knew the wardens had been outclassed once again. She burst into the treasury, and the ensuing confrontation left the Ecliptic Vaults a smoldering ruin, and the merry mischief maker Jinx nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>Jinx remains at large to this day, and is a constant thorn in Piltover\u2019s side. Her schemes have inspired copycat crimes among the chem-punks, as well as numerous satirical plays lampooning the incompetence of the wardens, and even a smattering of new colloquialisms throughout both cities\u2014though no one has yet had the courage to call Enforcer Vi \u201c<em>Pretty-in-Pink</em>\u201d to her face.</p>\n<p>Jinx\u2019s ultimate endgame, and her obvious obsession with Vi, both remain a mystery, but one thing is certain: her crimes are continuing and growing in sheer audacity.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>K\u2019Sante grew up immersed in his homeland\u2019s history. At dinner, his father told tales of their ancestors who used bravery and strength to resist the tyranny of the Ascended. His mother recounted the fearsome beasts these Nazuman founders slayed as they traversed south through Shurima, eventually discovering an area rich in the rarest of desert treasures\u2014roaring waterfalls, forested cliffs, and plentiful fauna. Far from the reach of the prideful Ascended, this was where the free republic of Nazumah laid its roots. K\u2019Sante absorbed every word, vowing to become Nazumah\u2019s greatest warrior-hunter\u2014one who could live up to the heroes from these stories and lead his people for generations to come.</p>\n<p>For two decades, K\u2019Sante trained under various martial teachers. However, it was his parents who taught him to respect Nazumah\u2019s enemies\u2014ruthless predators and imperialist warlords who coveted the city-state\u2019s resources. Remaining a free republic would require more than brute strength, they reminded him. During his training, K\u2019Sante studied with Nazuman scholars, learning how the materials reaped from formidable marks were used to craft advanced weaponry and infrastructure that enabled their homeland to thrive for five centuries. </p>\n<p>On his early hunts, K\u2019Sante forged many friendships, but his closest was with a young man from Marrowmark named Tope. Where K\u2019Sante was a blazing force in close combat, Tope specialized in ranged assault. Their chemistry was unmatched as they bested rockbear herds, shakkal raiding parties, and even Xer\u2019Sai stampedes. And as their teamwork grew stronger, so too did their bond.</p>\n<p>One starlit evening, K\u2019Sante confessed to Tope, admitting his feelings went beyond camaraderie. When he learned that Tope felt the same way, the two lovingly embraced and shared their first kiss. Together, in that moment under the stars, all seemed right.</p>\n<p>But all was not.</p>\n<p>Two Ascended, Emperor Azir and Magus Xerath, ravaged the continent in a war for dominance over Shurima, both deploying monstrous abominations among their forces. Nazuman scouts soon sighted one such creature\u2014a colossal predator shaped like a lion and a cobra that had wandered astray and was now terrorizing the nearby savanna. When the city-state\u2019s leaders asked who could quell the beast, K\u2019Sante and Tope pledged their might.</p>\n<p>On their first attempt, the beast deflected their every attack with powers neither man had seen before. They discovered that its armor, stretching from head to tail, regenerated from nonlethal blows. The men failed to draw blood and were forced to flee from the cobra-lion\u2019s lair with empty hands, leaving it to run wild.</p>\n<p>And so they tried again and again.</p>\n<p>K\u2019Sante\u2019s frustration burned. To become Nazumah\u2019s greatest, he <em>had </em>to slay this beast. Nothing else mattered. He trained dawn to dusk, convinced Tope would understand.</p>\n<p>Tope, meanwhile, studied the beast. He presented K\u2019Sante with strategies, watching his partner nod along in between assaults on their countless practice dummies. Quietly, Tope questioned if the two of them were strong enough.</p>\n<p>Their biggest success was an encounter where they managed to claim a piece of the cobra-lion\u2019s armor. Tope hailed this as progress and thought that if they sought more help, they could make even more headway.</p>\n<p>But K\u2019Sante seethed. He\u2019d begun to see the cobra-lion as his undertaking alone, and anything short of slaying the beast was a failure. The heroes he idolized when growing up never failed in battle. So K\u2019Sante couldn\u2019t either, especially not by accepting more support in what had become <em>his </em>battle to prove himself. He\u2019d tried Tope\u2019s ideas\u2014which weren\u2019t working\u2014and, now, Tope believed they weren\u2019t strong enough? K\u2019Sante wouldn\u2019t accept it. He began to wonder if Tope was holding him back and soon dismissed Tope\u2019s strategies as futile.</p>\n<p>Hurt, Tope insisted that tactless training was no better\u2014K'Sante's once admirable determination had turned into a self-serving, single-minded drive.</p>\n<p>As their pain and anger flared, further encounters with the cobra-lion resulted in further infighting, and the words they exchanged became fewer and fewer until there were none at all. Finally, it seemed the only thing they could agree on was to go their separate ways.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, K\u2019Sante kept training, stubborn and alone. His progress was measurable, but progress wasn\u2019t victory. He eventually had the crushing realization that strength alone could not fell the creature. He needed help.</p>\n<p>K\u2019Sante gathered the courage to visit Tope\u2019s home, only to learn his former partner had returned to Marrowmark. He was instead greeted by Tope\u2019s aunt. On K\u2019Sante\u2019s way out, she handed him Tope\u2019s journal, explaining that her nephew had left it to assist K\u2019Sante in his fight against his greatest monster.</p>\n<p>K\u2019Sante poured over Tope\u2019s journal. Gradually, he noticed the patterns in their mistakes, and when he arrived at the cobra-lion notes, K\u2019Sante was stunned. Tope claimed that the beast was a Baccai\u2014a failed Ascended being. He theorized that Xerath, known for his vile misuse of magic, had forced Shuriman fauna to fuse via the Ascension ritual. Engrossed, K\u2019Sante read the journal from front to back, discovering Tope\u2019s theories about how to slay the Baccai\u2014so many ideas K\u2019Sante had never considered himself. And by that evening, he\u2019d formulated a plan to practice Tope\u2019s methods on lesser monsters.</p>\n<p>As his skills grew, K\u2019Sante recalled his parents\u2019 teachings, realizing pride had led him astray. He\u2019d never respected Tope\u2019s ideas enough to try them in earnest. Truthfully, K\u2019Sante had respected his foe more than his partner. In time, he accepted his shortcomings and steadily moved on, thankful for what they had shared, but also grateful to walk his own path with a newfound perspective.</p>\n<p>Beneath a scarlet sky, K\u2019Sante approached the cobra-lion once more. He calculated every maneuver, dodging when the beast struck, and striking when the beast slipped. Sunrise became sundown. His weapons were shattered, and his body bloodied, but his spirit was unyielding. When the creature tired at long last, K\u2019Sante found his opportunity\u2014inspired by Tope\u2019s theories\u2014and cornered his foe against a Nazuman waterfall where the natural waters weakened the cobra-lion\u2019s armor, allowing K\u2019Sante to finally land a fatal blow.</p>\n<p>Exhausted, K\u2019Sante stood tall\u2014proud not of what he had accomplished, but of the journey he had taken.</p>\n<p>K\u2019Sante was celebrated by Nazumah upon his return. Following tradition, he donated the creature\u2019s body to the scholars for study, keeping only a couple slabs of its armor to refine the design of his signature ntofo weapons. They were now engineered to retain the armor\u2019s regenerative properties so that when their heavy outer layer shattered, K\u2019Sante could still wield them as sharp blades until they reformed. For a finishing detail, he carved onto each ntofo something Tope had drawn within his journal\u2014a symbol representing the cobra-lion. Though their time together had ended, K\u2019Sante knew his success was not achieved alone.</p>\n<p>Today, K\u2019Sante is hailed as the Pride of Nazumah. But if he is ever to become its greatest leader, he\u2019s learned he must never again let ego cloud his judgment. His home\u2019s future\u2014with the Ascended threat looming\u2014is uncertain. But K\u2019Sante knows that should Azir or Xerath dare march southward, he stands ready to fight.</p><br>",

She did not descend from tribal warriors hardened by generations of battle, nor was she summoned from distant lands to fight the unknowable menace lurking beneath Shurima. Rather, she was just an ordinary girl, born to loving parents who called the unforgiving southern deserts their home. This was where she would spend her days playing with friends, and her nights dreaming about her place in the world.</p>\n<p>In her tenth summer, the young girl Kaisa\u2019s destiny would be changed forever. Had she been older, she might have noticed more of the unusual events that had begun to unfold in the villages\u2014every day, her mother urged her stay home, for fear of strangers wandering the land, demanding tribute to dark powers below. Kaisa and her friends did not believe it, until one evening they came upon a pen of sacrificial goats bought from nomad herdsmen. Using the knife her father had given her on her eighth birthday, she cut their tethers and set the animals free into a nearby canyon. It seemed like a harmless prank, until the unthinkable happened. The ground began to quake, flashes of light scorched the sky, and the children ran for their lives.</p>\n<p>The Void had been awakened. A great rift split the bedrock, swallowing up Kaisa\u2019s village and everyone in it, leaving nothing behind but sand pierced with twisted columns as black as night.</p>\n<p>Kaisa regained consciousness to find herself trapped underground. She was filled with crippling fear, but there was still hope; she could hear the faint cries of other survivors. They called out to each other feebly, repeating their names one by one like a mantra. Sadly, by the third day, hers was the only voice left. Her friends and family were all gone. She was alone in the darkness.</p>\n<p>It was only when all seemed lost that she saw the light.</p>\n<p>She followed it down.</p>\n<p>Along the way, she found meager sustenance. Amid the debris left by the collapse were ragged waterskins, rotting peaches\u2014anything to keep starvation at bay. But, eventually, Kaisa\u2019s hunger was replaced by fear once again. She found herself in a vast cavern, illuminated by an otherworldly purplish glow, and she could see she was no longer alone.</p>\n<p>Skittering creatures swarmed in the depths. The first that came for Kaisa was no bigger than her, and she clutched her knife in both hands, ready to defend herself. The voidling horror knocked her to the ground, but she drove the blade into its pulsing heart, and the two of them tumbled deeper into the abyss.</p>\n<p>The creature was seemingly dead, but its unnatural skin had taken hold upon the flesh of her arm. The dark shell tingled, but was hard as steel to the touch. In a panic, Kaisa broke her knife trying to remove it. But when the larger beasts came, she used it as a shield to make her escape.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, she realized the shell was becoming part of her. As her daily struggle to survive drew out into years, this second skin grew with her, and so too did her resolve.</p>\n<p>Now she had more than hope, she had a plan. Fight hard. Stay alive. Find a way back.</p>\n<p>She was transformed, from frightened girl to fearless survivor, from prey to predator. For almost a decade, she has lived between two worlds in an attempt to keep them apart\u2014the Void hungers to consume not only the scattered villages of Shurima, but the whole of Runeterra. She will not allow that to happen. </p>\n<p>Though she has slain countless Void-constructs, she understands that many of the people she protects would see her as a monster herself.

She lived by a strict code of honor, serving the throne with utmost loyalty. The king had many enemies, and when they sent an assassin to slay him, it was Kalista\u2019s vigilance that averted disaster.</p><p>But in saving the king, she damned the one he loved most\u2014the assassin\u2019s deflected blade was envenomed, and sliced the arm of the queen. The greatest priests and surgeons were summoned, but none could draw the poison from her body. Wracked with grief, the king dispatched Kalista in search of a cure, with Hecarim of the Iron Order taking her place at his side.</p><p>Kalista traveled far, consulting learned scholars, hermits and mystics\u2026 but to no avail. Finally, she learned of a place protected from the outside world by shimmering pale mists, whose inhabitants were rumored to know the secrets of eternal life. She set sail on one last voyage of hope, to the almost legendary Blessed Isles.</p><p>The guardians of the capital city Helia saw the purity of Kalista\u2019s intent, and parted the mists to allow her safe passage. She begged them to heal the queen, and after much consideration, the masters of the city agreed. Time was of the essence. While the queen yet breathed, there was hope for her in the fabled Waters of Life. Kalista was given a talisman that would allow her to return to Helia unaided, but was warned against sharing this knowledge with any other.</p><p>However, by the time Kalista reached the shores of her homeland, the queen was already dead.</p><p>The king had descended into madness, locking himself in his tower with the queen\u2019s festering corpse. When he learned of Kalista\u2019s return, he demanded to know what she had found. With a heavy heart, for she had never before failed him, she admitted that the cure she had found would be of no use. The king would not believe this, and condemned Kalista as a traitor to the crown.</p><p>It was Hecarim who persuaded her to lead them to the Blessed Isles, where her uncle could hear the truth of it from the masters themselves. Then, perhaps, he would find peace\u2014even if only in accepting that the queen was gone, and allowing her to be laid to rest. Hesitantly, Kalista agreed.</p><p>And so the king set out with a flotilla of his fastest ships, and cried out in joy as the glittering city of Helia was revealed to him. However, they were met by the stern masters, who would not allow them to pass. Death, they insisted, was final. To cheat it would be to break the natural order of the world.</p><p>The king flew into a fevered rage, and commanded Kalista to slay any who opposed them. She refused, and called on Hecarim to stand with her\u2026 but instead he drove his spear through her armored back.</p><p>The Iron Order joined him in this treachery, piercing Kalista\u2019s body a dozen times more as she fell. A brutal melee erupted, with those devoted to Kalista fighting desperately against Hecarim\u2019s knights, but their numbers were too few. As Kalista\u2019s life faded, and she watched her warriors die, swearing vengeance with her final breath\u2026</p><p>When next Kalista opened her eyes, they were filled with the dark power of unnatural magic. She had no idea what had transpired, but the city of Helia had been transformed into a twisted mockery of its former beauty\u2014indeed, the entirety of the Blessed Isles was now a place of shadow and darkness, filled with howling spirits trapped for all eternity in the nightmare of undeath.</p><p>Though she tried to cling to those fragmented memories of Hecarim\u2019s monstrous betrayal, they have slowly faded in all the centuries since, and all that now remains is a thirst for revenge burning in Kalista\u2019s ruined chest. She has become a specter, a figure of macabre folklore, often invoked by those who have suffered similar treacheries.</p><p>These wretched spirits are subsumed into hers, to pay the ultimate price\u2014becoming one with the Spear of Vengeance.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Karma is the living embodiment of an ancient Ionian soul, who serves as a spiritual beacon to each generation of her people. Her most recent incarnation came in the form of a 12-year-old girl named Darha. Raised in the northern highlands of Shon-Xan, she was headstrong and independent, always dreaming of a life beyond her provincial village.</p><p>But Darha began to suffer strange, fitful visions. The images were curious\u2014they felt like memories, yet the girl was certain they had not happened to her. At first, the problem was easy enough to conceal, but the visions grew in intensity until Darha was convinced she was descending into madness.</p><p>Just when it seemed she would be confined to the healing huts forever, a group of monks visited her village. They had come from a place known as the Lasting Altar, where the divine leader Karma had passed away some months earlier. The monks were in search of the old man\u2019s next incarnation, believing him to be among the villagers. They applied a series of tests to everyone they met, but eventually prepared to leave empty handed.</p><p>As they passed the healing huts, Darha threw herself out of her cot and ran to stop them. She wept, telling them of her visions, and that she had known the monks\u2019 voices from the babble in her head.</p><p>They recognized the signs immediately. This was their Karma. The visions were past lives rushing to fill a new vessel.</p><p>In that moment, Darha\u2019s life changed forever. She bid farewell to all she\u2019d ever known, and journeyed to the Lasting Altar to learn from the monks. Over the years, they taught her to connect with her ancient soul, and to commune with thousands of previous incarnations, each espousing the wisdom of ages past. Karma had always advocated peace and harmony, teaching that any act of evil would bring about its own repercussions, and so required no response.</p><p>But Darha questioned these principles, even as she <i>became</i> Karma. Some of her followers were confused. How could she be invested with the Spirit of Ionia, the First Lands\u2019 most sacred manifestation, and yet disagree with their most self-evident philosophies?</p><p>Indeed, these beliefs were truly tested when Noxus invaded Ionia. Many thousands were killed as the enemy warbands advanced inland, and Karma was forced to face the harsh realities of war. She could feel the immense destructive potential that swelled in her soul, and wondered what the point of this power could be, if it was not to be used.</p><p>The voices of the past urged her to remain at the Lasting Altar, to comfort her people and allow this conflict to pass. And yet, a far deeper truth compelled her to act...</p><p>Karma agonized over this, until she could stand it no longer. She confronted a Noxian commander on the deck of his own war frigate, and unleashed her divine fury. This was no single, measured attack\u2014she obliterated the entire vessel and its crew in a heartbeat.</p><p>Though many Ionians rejoiced at this apparent victory, the monks believed she had made a huge mistake. She had upset the spiritual harmony of their homeland, disgracing all who had borne the name of Karma before her, and tarnished her own undying soul along with those of her followers. Even if it meant a life of solitary meditation and penance, they implored her to do no further injury.</p><p>Karma silenced them with a raised hand. Though she could still hear the voices in her head, it was the Spirit of Ionia in her heart that guided her\u2026 and the First Lands were stirring to defend themselves. She did not know if she had been chosen for her courage and strength of will, but Karma knew that sometimes harmony came only at a great cost. Their world was changing, and true wisdom lay not in resisting that fact, but accepting it.</p><p>Though the war with Noxus is now long over, there are still many in Ionia who have become only too glad to meet violence with violence, even against their own neighbors. Karma has pledged to guide as many of them as she can to a more enlightened path\u2014to peace when possible, to action when necessary.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>No mortal exemplifies the spiritual traditions of Ionia more than Karma. She is the living embodiment of an ancient soul reincarnated countless times, carrying all her accumulated memories into each new life, and blessed with power that few can comprehend. She has done her best to guide her people in recent times of crisis, though she knows that peace and harmony may come only at a considerable cost\u2014both to her, and to the land she holds most dear.</p>",

The living fear the eternity of undeath, but Karthus sees only beauty and purity in its embrace, a perfect union of life and death. When Karthus emerges from the Shadow Isles, it is to bring the joy of death to mortals, an apostle of the unliving.</p><p>Karthus was born into abject poverty in the sprawl of dwellings built beyond the walls of the Noxian capital. His mother died at the moment of his birth, leaving his father to raise him and his three sisters alone. They shared a crumbling, rat-infested almshouse with scores of other families, subsisting on a diet of rainwater and vermin. Of all the children, Karthus was the best ratter, and regularly brought gnawed corpses for the cook-pot.</p><p>Death was commonplace in the slums of Noxus, and many mornings began with the wailing of bereaved parents who woke to discover their child cold and lifeless beside them. Karthus learned to love these laments, and would watch, fascinated, as the tally-men of Kindred notched their staffs and bore the bodies from the almshouse. At night the young Karthus would sneak through the cramped rooms, seeking those whose lives hung by a thread, hoping to witness the moment their soul passed from life to death. For years, his nightly travels were fruitless, as it was impossible to predict exactly when a person would die. He was denied witnessing the moment of death until it reached his own family.</p><p>Outbreaks of disease were frequent in such cramped confines, and when Karthus\u2019s sisters sickened with the plague, he watched over them intently. While his father drowned his grief, Karthus was the ever dutiful brother, caring for his sisters as the disease consumed them. He watched each of them as they died, and a sublime connection seemed to reach into him as the light faded from their eyes - a yearning to see what lay beyond death and unlock the secrets of eternity. When the tally-men came for the bodies, Karthus followed them back to their temple, asking them question after question about their order and the workings of death. Could a person exist at the moment where life ends, but before death begins? If such a liminal moment could be understood and held, might the wisdom of life be combined with the clarity of death?</p><p>The tally-men quickly recognized Karthus\u2019s suitability for their order and he was inducted into their ranks, first as a digger of graves and pyre-builder, before ascending to the rank of corpse collector. Karthus guided his bone-cart around the streets of Noxus to gather the dead every day. His dirges quickly became known throughout Noxus, mournful laments that spoke to the beauty of death and the hope that what lay beyond was something to be embraced. Many a grieving family took solace in his songs, finding a measure of peace in his heartfelt elegies. Eventually, Karthus worked in the temple itself, tending to the sick in their final moments, watching as whatever death had laid its claim upon them took its due. Karthus would speak to each person laid before him, ushering their souls into death, in search of further wisdom in their fading eyes.</p><p>Eventually, Karthus reached the conclusion that he could learn no more from mortals, that only the dead themselves could answer his questions. None of the dying souls could tell of what lay beyond, but whispered rumors and tales told to frighten children echoed of a place where death was not the end - The Shadow Isles.</p><p>Karthus emptied the temple\u2019s coffers and bought passage to Bilgewater, a city plagued by a strange black mist said to draw souls to a cursed island far out at sea. No captain was willing to take Karthus to the Shadow Isles, but eventually he came upon a rum-sodden fisherman with a mountain of debts and nothing to lose. The boat plied the ocean for many days and nights, until a storm drove them onto the rocks of an island that appeared on no charts. A black mist rolled out from a haunted landscape of gnarled trees and tumbled ruins. The fisherman freed his boat and turned its prow in terror for Bilgewater, but Karthus leapt into the sea and waded ashore. Steadying himself with his notched tally-staff, he proudly sang the lament he had prepared for the moment of his own death, and his words were carried on a cold wind to the heart of the island.</p><p>The black mist flowed through Karthus, ravaging his flesh and spirit with ancient sorcery, but such was the force of his desire to transcend mortality that it did not destroy him. Instead, it remade him, and Karthus was born anew in the waters of the island as a fleshless revenant.</p><p>Revelation filled Karthus as he became what he always believed he should have been; a being poised at the threshold of death and life. The beauty of this eternal moment filled him with wonder as the wretched spirits of the island rose to behold his transformation, drawn to his passion like predators scenting blood in the ocean. Finally, Karthus was where he belonged, surrounded by those who truly understood the boon undeath truly was. Filled with righteous zeal, he knew he had to return to Valoran and share his gift with the living, to free them from petty mortal concerns.</p><p>Karthus turned and the Black Mist bore him over the waves to the fisherman\u2019s boat. The man fell to his knees before Karthus, begging for his life, and Karthus granted him the blessing of death, ending his mortal suffering and raising him up as an immortal spirit as he sang his lament for passing souls. The fisherman was the first of many such souls Karthus would free, and soon the Deathsinger would command a legion of unliving wraiths. To Karthus\u2019s awakened senses, the Shadow Isles was in a state of apathetic limbo, where the blessings of death were squandered. He would galvanize the dead in a crusade to bring the beauty of oblivion to the living, to end the suffering of mortality and usher in a glorious age of undeath.</p><p>Karthus has become the emissary of the Shadow Isles, the herald of oblivion whose laments are paeans to the glory of death. His legions of unbound souls join with his funereal dirges, their haunting song reaching beyond the Black Mist to be heard on cold nights over graveyards and charnel houses all across Valoran.</p>",
                "lore_short": "The harbinger of oblivion, Karthus is an undying spirit whose haunting songs are a prelude to the horror of his nightmarish appearance. The living fear the eternity of undeath, but Karthus sees only beauty and purity in its embrace, a perfect union of life and death. When Karthus emerges from the Shadow Isles, it is to bring the joy of death to mortals, an apostle of the unliving.",

He spent many years exploring the ancient ruins of his homeland, making his employers exceedingly wealthy, but it wasn\u2019t until a dig near Zirima that he found a treasure of his own\u2014he fell in love with a woman from one of the desert tribes.<br> <br>With his wife and newborn daughter, Kassadin settled in a small village in the rocky canyons to the south. He was on the road often, his work sometimes requiring him to accompany particularly valuable relics to some faraway sponsor. But, no matter where his travels took him, Kassadin would always return with exciting tales from the world beyond.<br> <br>Journeying home from distant Piltover, Kassadin and his fellow caravaneers were watering their beasts at an oasis when they encountered the first terrified survivors stumbling out of the desert. They spoke of the disaster that had claimed their homes, as if the maw of the underworld itself had opened up to devour them. They had barely escaped with their lives.<br> <br>Fearing for his own family\u2019s safety, Kassadin left the others behind, riding hard, driving his mount almost to exhaustion. When he finally reached the place where his village had once stood, he found only shifting sand and rubble. He clawed at the debris until his hands bled, screaming out his wife and daughter\u2019s names, though no answer came. Days later, Kassadin\u2019s companions caught up to him, now just a broken and empty man weeping beneath the scorching sun.<br> <br>They dragged him back to Zirima, but Kassadin would go no further. For years, he tried to drown his grief, reduced to little more than a vagrant\u2026 until word reached town of \u201cthe Prophet.\u201d<br> <br>Whispers of unspeakable horrors that dwelt beneath the earth, and of sacrifices made in their name, chilled Kassadin to the bone. He knew well the legends of old Icathia, and the fate that befell that accursed place\u2014if the Void had been deliberately drawn toward Shurima once more, then it had likely been the death of his entire village, and countless more besides. He also knew there were few, if any, who could stand against it.<br> <br>In that moment, Kassadin swore that he would avenge his wife and daughter, by destroying this insidious Prophet, and the source of his abyssal power. He was a man who had made his living by finding safe paths through the most dangerous places, and resolved to arm himself with the most arcane and esoteric weapons ever known in Valoran, fused with Zaunite ingenuity, and blessed by Ionian spirit-healers. He called in every favor he could, from scholars of antiquities to common smugglers, for their help in\u2026 <em>acquiring</em> what he sought. Many called him a madman, believing this the last time they would ever see their old friend alive\u2014Kassadin merely thanked them for their concern, and bid them farewell. He would face the Void alone.<br> <br>Last of all, he stole the infamous Nether Blade of Horok, the sword that had slain a thousand deceivers in the latter days of the empire. He could feel the cold pull of oblivion in its edge, but no longer had any regard for his own mortality, and nothing of his old life left to lose.<br> <br>Disguised in the robes of a pilgrim, more than a decade since he had last set foot anywhere near that desolate land, Kassadin made his way into Icathia.

While her younger sister Cassiopeia took after their politically brilliant mother, Katarina was very much her father\u2019s daughter, and the wily General Du Couteau pushed her to learn the way of the blade; to cut away the empire\u2019s enemies not with reckless brutality, but deadly precision. He was a harsh teacher with many pupils, and notoriously difficult to impress.</p><p>So it was that Katarina\u2019s childhood\u2014if it can be called such\u2014had little room for kindness or rest. She spent every waking moment honing herself into the ultimate weapon, testing her endurance, her dexterity, her tolerance for pain. She stole poisons from the city\u2019s least reputable apothecaries, testing their efficacy in tiny increments upon herself, gradually building her resistance even as she catalogued their effects. She scaled the tallest towers in the dead of night, unseen by anyone.</p><p>She yearned to do her part for Noxus. She yearned for the opportunity to demonstrate her hidden strengths in service of the empire, and the throne.</p><p>Her first mark came straight from her father, camped with his warbands on the eve of one of the military\u2019s innumerable westward invasions\u2026 She was to assassinate a line officer of the opposing army, a low-born wretch by the name of Demetrius.</p><p>Katarina was livid. She hadn\u2019t trained her entire life to have her talents wasted on some dungheel barely skilled enough to swing a sword! He simply wouldn\u2019t do. Instead of her assigned target, Katarina stole into the enemy camp and slit the enemy commander\u2019s throat as he slept. It was a flawless execution. It would bring a swift victory, and glory to Noxus. It would make her father proud.</p><p>At dawn, his face daubed with ashes, the vengeful hero Demetrius led a berzerk charge into her father\u2019s encampment. Dozens of Noxian soldiers were slaughtered, along with the general\u2019s personal retinue. Katarina\u2019s father himself barely escaped with his life.</p><p>He was furious beyond words, refusing even to look his daughter in the eye. She had shamed him, and their family name. The greatest assassins do not seek recognition or glory, he reminded her. They do not expect to occupy a place of honor at their master\u2019s right hand.</p><p>Overwhelmed, Katarina struck out into the wilderness, alone. She would complete her original mission. Demetrius would pay with his life. Even so, her mind swam. Could she ever forgive herself? How had she been so foolish?</p><p>She was so distracted, she didn\u2019t see her attacker until he had nearly taken her eye out.</p><p>For Katarina\u2019s failure, General Du Couteau had sent another of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s after her; a nameless whelp dragged up from one of the lesser assassins\u2019 guilds. But even with blood streaming down her face, the years of rigorous training kicked in, and her blades were in her hands in an instant.</p><p>Six hours later, she tossed Demetrius\u2019s severed head at her father\u2019s feet.</p><p>She told the general she had considered taking <i>his</i> head instead, but eventually decided\u2014as much as she hated to admit it\u2014that he had done the right thing in ordering her death. She had failed. Not just as an assassin, or as a daughter, but as a <i>Noxian</i>. </p><p>And failure must have its consequences. She ran her fingers along the raw, deep gash over her left eye, and thought of the price others had paid for her arrogance.</p><p>She knew she had lost her father\u2019s favor, and could never regain it. He would raise others in her place, simply to spite her. Still, she vowed to redeem herself, no matter the cost\u2014to rededicate her talents to the empire, and to become the sinister weapon she always intended to be.</p>",

Their parents, Mihira and Kilam, began the perilous climb in search of the power to save their tribe from destruction.</p><p>Even when Mihira learned she was with child, she pushed onward. At the mountain\u2019s summit, she was chosen as a divine vessel for the Aspect of Justice, wielding a sword that blazed with a fire brighter than the sun.</p><p>Not long after, the twins were born. Kayle, the elder by a breath, was as bright as Morgana was dark.</p><p>But Mihira had become a fearsome warrior, far greater than any mortal. Kilam began to fear her new divinity, and the sorcerous enemies that were drawn to her light. He resolved to take the girls out of harm\u2019s way, journeying across the Conqueror\u2019s Sea to a settlement where the land itself was said to offer protection against magic.</p><p>In their new homeland, Kilam raised the twins, their temperaments growing more different with each passing day. Kayle was precocious, often arguing with the settlement\u2019s leaders about their rules\u2014she had no real memory of her mother\u2019s powers, but knew the laws were meant to keep them all safe. Her father rarely spoke of such things, but Kayle was certain Mihira had saved them by ending the Rune Wars on some distant battlefield.</p><p>When the twins were teenagers, a streak of flame split the sky. A sword smoldering with celestial fire struck the ground between Kayle and her sister, breaking in two\u2014Kilam was distraught when he recognized the blade as Mihira\u2019s.</p><p>Kayle eagerly snatched up one half of the weapon, feathered wings springing forth from her shoulders, and Morgana cautiously followed her example. In that moment, Kayle felt more connected to her mother than ever, certain that this was a sign she was alive and wanted her daughters to follow the same path as her.</p><p>The people of the settlement believed the girls had been blessed by the stars, destined to protect the fledgling nation of Demacia from outsiders. These winged protectors became symbols of light and truth, and were revered by all. Kayle fought in many battles, flying at the head of the growing militia and imbuing the weapons of the worthy with her own sanctified fire\u2026 but in time, her pursuit of justice began to consume her. Seeing threats within and without, she founded a judicator order to enforce the law, and hunted down rebels and reavers with equal fervor.</p><p>But there was one person she softened her judgment toward. To the dismay of her followers, Kayle allowed Morgana to rehabilitate wrongdoers who appeared humble enough to admit their guilt. Kayle\u2019s protege, Ronas, was the most disapproving of all\u2014he swore to do what Kayle would not, and attempted to imprison Morgana.</p><p>Kayle returned to find the people rioting, and Ronas dead. Consumed by rage, she looked down upon the city, and summoned her divine fire to cleanse the city of its sins.</p><p>Morgana flew up to meet her, raising her blade. If Kayle was to purge the darkness she saw in mortal hearts, she would have to start with her own sister. The two battled across the heavens, each matching the other\u2019s terrible blows and striking the buildings beneath them to rubble.</p><p>Abruptly, the fight was halted by their father\u2019s anguished cry.</p><p>Kayle watched Kilam die in her sister\u2019s arms, a senseless victim of the violence that had overtaken the city that day. Then she held the two halves of their mother\u2019s sword in her hands, and vowed she would never again let mortal emotions rule her. As she leapt back into the sky, soaring high above the clouds, she felt she could almost see Mount Targon beyond the horizon, its formidable peak bathed red by the setting sun.</p><p>There she would seek perfect, celestial clarity. There she would stand at her mother\u2019s side, and fulfill her legacy to the Aspect of Justice.</p><p>Though she has been absent from Demacia for many centuries, Kayle\u2019s legend has inspired much of the kingdom\u2019s culture and law. Grand statues and icons of the Winged Protector give strength to the heart of every warrior who marches to illuminate the night, and banish all shadows from their land.</p><p>In times of strife and chaos, there are many who cling to the hope that Kayle might eventually return\u2026 and others who pray that such a day will never come.</p>",

Still, legends are told of her punishing the unjust with her fiery swords, and many hope that she will one day return\u2026",

Following the disastrous battle at the Placidium of Navori, the invasion was deliberately reformulated into a protracted war of attrition. Ionian compassion was a weakness to be exploited\u2014their warriors would hesitate before striking down a supposed innocent. Thus, barely able to lift the blade he had been given, Kayn\u2019s first day in battle was also expected to be his last.</p><p>Striking against the province of Bahrl, Noxian forces landed at the mouth of the Epool River. Kayn and the others were a reluctant vanguard, facing disorganized bands of locals defending their home from these returning invaders. While his young comrades were cut down or fled the battlefield, Kayn showed no fear. He dropped his heavy sword and snatched up a fallen sickle, turning to face the shocked Ionians just as the Noxian regulars swept in from the flank.</p><p>The carnage was staggering. Farmers, hunters\u2014even a handful of vastaya\u2014all were butchered without ceremony.</p><p>Two days later, after word had spread throughout the southern provinces, the Order of Shadow came upon the grisly scene. Their leader, Zed, knew this area had no tactical significance. This massacre was intended as a message. Noxus would show no mercy.</p><p>A flickering glint of steel caught his eye. A child of no more than ten lay in the mud, leveling his broken sickle at the master assassin, bloody knuckles straining white. The boy\u2019s eyes harbored a pain that belied his age, yet still burned with all the fury of a hardened warrior. This tenacity was not something that could be taught. Zed saw in this child, this abandoned Noxian survivor, a weapon that could be turned against those who had sent him here to die. The assassin held out his hand and welcomed Kayn into the Order of Shadow.</p><p>Acolytes traditionally spent years training with a single weapon of their choosing, but Kayn mastered them all\u2014to him, they were mere tools, and he was the weapon. Armor he viewed as a cumbersome burden, instead cloaking himself in shadows and slaying his enemies with quickness and stealth. These swift executions instilled fear in the hearts of those fortunate enough to be spared.</p><p>And as Kayn\u2019s legend grew, so did his arrogance. He truly believed that one day his power would eclipse even that of Zed himself.</p><p>This hubris led Kayn to embrace his final test: to seek out a darkin weapon recently unearthed in Noxus, and prevent it from ever being used against the weary defenders of Ionia. He accepted without hesitation, never questioning why he had been chosen for this task. Indeed, where any other acolyte would have destroyed the living scythe known as Rhaast, Kayn took it for himself.</p><p>The corruption took hold the moment his fingers closed around the weapon, locking them both in a fateful struggle. Rhaast has long awaited the perfect host in order to rejoin its darkin brethren and lay waste to the world, but Kayn will not be easily dominated. He returns to Ionia in triumph, convinced that Zed will name him the new leader of the Order of Shadow.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>A riotous domain of constant transformation, Bandle City was no place for a yordle like Kennen. Searching for harmony and balance, he ventured out from the spirit realm millennia ago. He explored the material realm with boundless curiosity, traveling great distances in a heartbeat. But he was drawn in particular to Ionia.</p><p>In the First Lands, he witnessed ancient wars that none now remember, and a land struggling to rebuild afterward. Kennen grew fascinated by a people seeking balance for themselves and their home. Over time, he returned to Bandle City less and less, choosing to remain in Ionia, where yordles were respected as creatures of the spirit realm. Though he did not age as beings of the material realm did, Kennen embraced mortals, studying them for generations. He admired how, despite their fragile lives, they were diligent protectors of the sacred balance.</p><p>Even so, there were threats to the tranquility of Ionia. Malevolent entities of the spirit realm traversed the land with ill intent. Kennen battled these disturbances alone for years, enjoying the fun each challenge brought, but in the end he understood he was doing little to address <i>why</i> the incursions were happening: imbalance. He discovered a fledgling order whose members actively pursued balance between the realms\u2014who, after careful observation, would judge what needed to be done to restore it.</p><p>They called themselves the Kinkou.</p><p>Kennen was intrigued by the order, led by a distant Eye of Twilight and a vindictive Fist of Shadow. He realized that the Kinkou\u2019s leadership required another aspect. A consensus builder, one who would prevent the warlike Fist from domineering over the introspective Eye, and likewise keep the Eye\u2019s tireless observation from paralyzing the Fist.</p><p>As a creature of both the spirit and material realms, Kennen proposed that he was uniquely suited to be an arbiter. The order accepted Kennen\u2019s wisdom, and he became the Kinkou\u2019s first Heart of the Tempest. As part of the new triumvirate with the Eye of Twilight and the Fist of Shadow, Kennen passed judgment on how best to preserve balance, and his affability and diplomacy kept the Kinkou in harmony.</p><p>Moreover, Kennen noticed that a rift had grown between the order and the people around them, as judgments were carried out swiftly, mysteriously, and without chance for appeal. Again, the yordle realized he could fill a need for the Kinkou. With his fantastic speed and compassion, he was the ideal representative to communicate the judgments of the order to those affected by them. He\u2019d seen how the Kinkou distanced themselves from the people, wearing masks over their faces, and took care to remove his to connect with those he sought to protect.</p><p>Yet there was another side to Kennen, a far more serious aspect as Heart of the Tempest. Charged with <i>Coursing the Sun</i>, he addressed challenges to the Kinkou\u2019s judgments, and not always with words.</p><p>For sometimes, the cost of balance was the blood of the offender\u2014and Kennen\u2019s shuriken and summoned maelstroms were quite capable of silencing all dissent.</p><p>There have been many threats to the Kinkou over the centuries, but none as grave as the Noxian invasion and its aftermath. When Noxus invaded the First Lands, Kennen opposed joining the resistance, even as the war threatened to tear the Kinkou apart. In their darkest hour, after a coup led by a former acolyte named Zed, the yordle guided the order while the new Eye of Twilight, Shen, struggled to lead. Kennen urged the Fist of Shadow, Mayym, to look to her daughter Akali, whom he\u2019d trained since childhood, and see her as a successor.</p><p>But even he couldn\u2019t find the words to stop Akali from eventually leaving the Kinkou, frustrated at the order\u2019s failure to act against Ionia\u2019s enemies.</p><p>Recent events have tested Kennen, a new age of disruption and violence that has thrown Ionia into chaos. Come what may, he will protect the fractured Kinkou Order, fighting alongside Shen to defend the balance of the First Lands. Do not let Kennen\u2019s diminutive appearance fool you\u2014for the heart of the tempest is its calmest part, but when it turns its eye upon you, its force is never more than a moment behind.</p>",

He is an icon revered by the common soldiery, which is increasingly a cause of concern to their commanders\u2014for there are some among the warhosts who claim to have <i>literally</i> served beside him.</p><p>Tall tales such as \u201cThe Great Hussar\u2019s Victory\u201d, \u201cThe Return of the High General Marshal-Sergeant\u201d, and \u201cThe Mountain Admiral\u201d abound, which strongly imply Kled has fought in every campaign ever waged, acquired every military title, and never once backed down from a fight. Though the details are often outlandish and contradictory, the essence of the tale remains: charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what\u2019s his\u2026 and takes whatever else he can get.</p><p>In truth, the Cantankerous Cavalier hails from another land entirely\u2014Bandle City. As a yordle, he made his home among the proud Noxii tribes in the wake of the Rune Wars, and has never looked back.</p><p>The earliest mention of Kled in historical records was at the First Battle of Drugne. In the dusty hills of those badlands, the warhost of General Zaavan was on the run from barbarian foes. Having lost the previous two engagements, morale was low. The supply train had been abandoned in the rout, and they were a week\u2019s march from the nearest outpost. Zaavan, in his spotless armor, seemed more concerned with how this would appear back home than the welfare of his soldiers, and ordered a defensive circle formation to buy himself time to think.</p><p>Then, as the morning sun rose, the lone figure of Kled appeared on the hilltop, mounted upon a desert drakalops. This warrior\u2019s weapon was rusted, his armor worn, his clothes tattered\u2014but contempt and anger burned in his one good eye.</p><p>He bellowed an ultimatum to the barbarian horde, demanding that they leave his lands or be destroyed. However, he did not wait for any response, spurring his steed and screaming the charge. Desperate, starving, and furious with their general, the Noxian warhost\u2019s anger ignited at the sight of this act of bravado. They rushed after Kled as he tore into the enemy.</p><p>What followed was one of the bloodiest melees ever fought on the northern steppes. The initial momentum of the counterattack was crushed beneath a hail of barbarian arrows from higher ground, but Kled fought on even after he was thrown from his saddle and his drakalops fled. He always seemed to be at the heart of the battle, chopping down foes, kicking out teeth, and biting faces. The bodies piled up around him, and his clothes were soaked with blood. He screamed louder challenges and cruder insults. Clearly, this great warrior was willing to die before ever backing down.</p><p>Cowardice can be infectious, but so too can courage. Where the Noxians might have given up and fled for their lives, instead they were inspired to make one last stand.</p><p>Even Kled\u2019s drakalops returned, and crashed into the barbarians\u2019 rearguard, snarling and clawing as it dived in to free its master. With his mount again beneath him, Kled became a veritable whirlwind of death, and it was the barbarians who broke and ran.</p><p>Though too few of the Noxian soldiers survived that day for it to be considered a victory, Drugne was contested long enough that word reached the Immortal Bastion, and reinforcements were sent. The war ground on for at least another decade, until the barbarian leaders sued for peace\u2014their strength was added to Noxus, and Drugne became a foothold for continued campaigns across Dalamor and the north for many centuries to come.</p><p>The body of General Zaavan\u2014and his fine armor\u2014was never found.</p><p>In time, countless other warhosts of the empire acquired similar stories of Kled. It has long been said that he rides wherever Noxians march, claiming the spoils of war for himself. Indeed, in their wake, good-humored signs can often be found proclaiming each new territory <i>\u201cProperty of Kled\u201d</i>.</p>",

This baleful beacon&apos;s gentle flicker - now fastened to Runeterra - drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between the spaces which were never meant to meet. There amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, Kog&apos;Maw manifested in Valoran with unsettling curiosity. The spark which led him to Runeterra teased him still, urging him gently towards Malzahar. It also encouraged him to familiarize himself with his new environment, to the stark horror of everything he encountered on his journey.</p><p>The enchanting colors and aromas of Runeterra intoxicated Kog&apos;Maw, and he explored the fruits of the strange world the only way he knew how: by devouring them. At first he sampled only the wild flora and fauna he happened across. As he traversed the parched Tempest Flats, however, he came upon a tribe of nomads. Seemingly unhampered by conventional rules of physics, Kog&apos;Maw consumed every nomad and any obstacles they put in his way, amounting to many times his own mass and volume. The most composed of his victims may have had time to wonder if this was due to the caustic enzymes which stung the ground as they dripped from his gaping mouth, although such musings were abruptly concluded. Even this feeding frenzy did nothing to satiate Kog&apos;Maw&apos;s appetite. His swathe of destruction continues still as he is inexorably drawn towards Malzahar. What happens when he finds him is anyone&apos;s guess.</p>",

Perhaps it is unknown even to herself, after so many centuries of mimicry and deception\u2026<br> <br>Remnants of an order that has existed far longer than Noxus itself, initiates of the Black Rose have schemed from the shadows for centuries, drawing the rich and powerful to their ranks. Though they do not often learn the origins of their matron, many have uncovered legends of a pale sorceress who aided the broken barbarian tribes, in their struggle against the infamous Iron Revenant subjugating lands already ravaged by the darkin. Even today, his name is whispered in fear: <i>Mordekaiser</i>.<br> <br>Uniquely skilled among the revenant\u2019s inner circle before she betrayed him, the sorceress pledged to neutralize the source of his power, the Immortal Bastion, cutting him off from the well of death that fueled his nightmarish empire. Yet, even as the barbarians built an empire of their own in the bastion\u2019s shadow, they failed to realize that the arcane secrets it held had not completely been locked away. The pale sorceress had always been gifted at illusion, and her greatest trick was to make Noxus forget the dark power roiling in its own heart, before she was burned from the pages of history around the time of the Rune Wars.<br> <br>The Black Rose exists now to further the clandestine interests of those who can wield such magic\u2014with its rank-and-file composed of mundane nobles, drawn to rumors of miracles, kept in thrall and ruthlessly exploited. Even the most powerful military commander could only ever serve the cult\u2019s true masters, as they fight one another for influence in games of intrigue and conquest, both in the Noxian capital and beyond its borders.</p><p>For centuries, LeBlanc has served in secret as an advisor to foreign dignitaries, appearing in many nations at once, her illusions driving order into chaos. Rumors of a new matron rising with each generation only raise further questions\u2014which is the \u201ctrue\u201d version of herself? When she speaks, is it with her own voice? And what will the price be, for the favor she offers?</p><p>Boram Darkwill was but the latest to learn this last answer for himself. Though the Black Rose had aided his bid for the throne, he refused the counsel of their hand-picked advisors, requiring LeBlanc to take drastic measures. Manipulating a young nobleman named Jericho Swain into revealing the cult\u2019s involvement, LeBlanc allowed herself to be executed along with the most prominent conspirators\u2026 or at least, so it appeared. In time, she reached out to Darkwill herself, and found an increasingly paranoid ruler, fearful of his own mortality.<br> <br>After promising him the secrets to extend his life, LeBlanc slowly poisoned Darkwill\u2019s mind, even as she empowered him. Under his rule, the Noxian reverence of strength became something far more sinister, and together they ensured Swain\u2019s legend would end in disgrace on the battlefields of Ionia.<br> <br>But Swain, emboldened by forbidden lore from within the Immortal Bastion, did something wholly unexpected, managing to drag Darkwill from the throne and seize Noxus for himself. This new Grand General was not interested in his own legacy, but the glory of the empire\u2014and such a man could not so easily be corrupted. After countless centuries, LeBlanc wondered, had she finally found a worthy nemesis?<br> <br>Her actions have pushed Runeterra to the brink of all-out war many times. In the wake of desperate campaigns across the Freljord, on Targon\u2019s peaks, and deep in Shurima\u2019s deserts, the darkest magic has begun to spread once more, circling closer and closer to Noxus. Whether LeBlanc is still the same pale sorceress who betrayed the Iron Revenant, or merely one of countless hollow reflections, her influence clearly stems from ancient roots.<br> <br>The Black Rose has yet to truly bloom.</p>",

Always plotting just out of sight, LeBlanc\u2019s true motives are as inscrutable as her shifting identity.",

Few can say for certain, and fewer still have ever been able to channel the dragon\u2019s spirit, and none so completely as Lee Sin.</p><p>He arrived at the Shojin monastery as a boy, claiming the dragon had chosen him to wield its power. The elder monks saw flashes of its fire in the talented child, but also sensed his reckless pride, and the disaster it could bring. Warily, they nonetheless took him as a pupil\u2014though, as others advanced, the elders kept him cleaning dishes and scrubbing floors.</p><p>Lee Sin grew impatient. He longed to fulfill his destiny, not waste time on chores.</p><p>Sneaking into the hidden archives, he found ancient texts describing how to call upon the spirit realm, and chose to flaunt his skill during a combat lesson. Brashly, he unleashed the dragon\u2019s rage in a wild kick, paralyzing his learned instructor. Consumed with shame and banished for his arrogance, the young man set out to atone.</p><p>Years passed. Lee Sin wandered far, to distant places, benevolently aiding those in need. Eventually he reached the Freljord, where he met Udyr, a wildman who channeled the primal beasts of his homeland. The so-called Spirit Walker struggled to control the powers that warred within him, and Lee Sin began to wonder if controlling the dragon was even possible. Sharing a need for spiritual guidance, the two men forged a bond, and he invited Udyr on his journey back home.</p><p>The two were dismayed to hear that the empire of Noxus had invaded and occupied Ionia. Monks from every province had fallen back to defend the holy monastery at Hirana, high up in the mountains.</p><p>Lee Sin and Udyr found it besieged. Noxian soldiers had broken through to Hirana\u2019s great hall. As Udyr leapt to join the fray, Lee Sin hesitated, seeing his former peers and elders fall to the enemy\u2019s blades. The wisdom of Hirana, Shojin, so much of Ionia\u2019s ancient culture\u2014all would be lost.</p><p>With no other choice left, he invoked the dragon spirit.</p><p>A tempest of flames engulfed him, searing his skin and burning the sight from his eyes. Imbued with wild power, he crippled the invaders with a flurry of breakneck punches and rapid kicks, the untamable spirit flaring brighter and hotter with each blow.</p><p>The monks were victorious, but Lee Sin\u2019s desperate actions left the monastery in ruins, and his vision would never return. At last, in the blind darkness, he understood that no mortal could ever bend the might of the dragon spirit to their will completely. Devastated, agonized, he bound a cloth over his sightless eyes and tried to stagger away down the mountain paths.</p><p>But the surviving elders stopped him. In forsaking all desire for power, their disgraced pupil was finally ready to begin anew. Although they would not forget his previous arrogance, the monks offered absolution: the dragon\u2019s wrath was deadly and unpredictable, true enough, but the humblest and worthiest mortal souls could counter its fiery nature, and direct it from time to time.</p><p>Gratefully, Lee Sin stayed with the monks to rebuild their monastery, and after the work was done and the Spirit Walker returned to the Freljord, Lee Sin devoted himself fully toward the pursuit of enlightenment.</p><p>In the years since the war with Noxus ended, he has continued to meditate on his role in Ionia. Knowing his homeland has not faced the last of its trials, Lee Sin must master himself, and the dragon spirit within, to face whatever foe is yet to come.</p>",

Enemies who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse kicks.",

None doubted she would one day become one of the <i>Ra\u2019Horak</i>, the holy warriors of the Solari.</p><p>Though Leona flourished, she could not help but see her masters struggle with their most exasperating student, an orphan named Diana. Her curiosity was welcomed at first, but soon the teachers began to perceive Diana\u2019s questions as challenging the Solari ways. Leona watched Diana suffer punishment and isolation\u2014but where others saw insolence, she saw a lost soul devoted to a search for meaning.</p><p>Leona found her purpose in the Solari teachings, and resolved to share it with Diana as even the most dutiful teachers forsook her. The two would debate late into the night, with Leona hoping to persuade Diana that everything she could ever want was there in the faith, waiting for her to accept it. Though she failed to win Diana over, Leona did find a friend.</p><p>One night, Diana confided a secret to Leona. She spoke of discovering a hidden alcove in the mountain, an ancient place where the walls were etched with depictions of strange symbols and forgotten societies. When Diana mentioned climbing the summit of Mount Targon to learn more, Leona urged her to stop. Seeking to protect her from the ire of the other Solari, Leona made Diana promise to abandon this search. Reluctantly, Diana agreed.</p><p>Time passed, and the two never spoke of Diana\u2019s discovery again. Leona believed her friend had finally come to her senses.</p><p>Her belief was shattered late one night, when she glimpsed Diana slipping out of the temple. While her first instinct was to tell the elders, Leona thought instead of protecting her friend, wresting her back from the edge. Resolved, Leona set off after Diana\u2026</p><p>To the summit of Mount Targon.</p><p>The ascent was a trial unlike any Leona had ever endured, straining every fiber of her being to its limit, and beyond. Her training, willpower, and concern for Diana was all that drove her on. The unblinking eyes of bodies frozen into the mountain's slopes watched her climb, their own journeys forever incomplete, but not even they could deter her.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity\u2014and much to her own amazement\u2014Leona reached the peak.</p><p>Exhausted, she beheld an uncanny landscape, and found Diana engulfed in a coruscating column of silver light. Leona saw her friend\u2019s silhouette writhing in agony, the air rippling with her screams. Horrified, Leona rushed to her aid, when a golden radiance slashed down from the heavens to envelop her.</p><p>The sensation was indescribable, but rather than incinerating Leona, the illumination coursed into her, suffusing her with incredible power. She clung to her consciousness, fighting the current seeking to sear away her very being.</p><p>Ultimately, her indomitable will triumphed\u2014and with that control came understanding.</p><p>With control came understanding. Leona was forever changed, imbued by the Aspect of the Sun. Destiny had selected <i>her</i>, and it was her duty to protect the Solari in the times to come.</p><p>It was then that Leona saw Diana, clad in gleaming silver war-plate, a strange reflection of the golden armor she discovered herself now wearing. Diana begged Leona to join her, to seek out answers the Solari could not offer. Leona demanded they return home, and present themselves for the priests\u2019 judgment. Neither conceded, and they finally felt the weight of the weapons in their hands.</p><p>Their combat was swift, a blistering clash between sun and moon, ending with Diana\u2019s crescent blade at Leona\u2019s throat. But, rather than delivering the killing blow, Diana fled. Devastated, Leona descended Targon and hurried to her elders.</p><p>When she arrived, she found slaughter. Many Solari priests and their Ra\u2019Horak guardians were dead, seemingly slain by Diana\u2019s hand. The survivors were awed by the presence of <i>two</i> Aspects now in their midst, and Leona was committed to helping them navigate this new reality\u2014the guiding light to her people, just as the sun had always been.</p><p>She has sworn to find Diana, to preserve the dominance of the Solari... but also to help her old friend control the Moon Aspect\u2019s power before it destroys her.</p>",

Forests spread vibrantly, and trees often boast nearly as many colors as leaves, touched by the wonders of the spirit realm.</p><p>But there is one forest, hidden away, that draws on a different kind of magic\u2014a garden with a tree at its heart that gathers humanity\u2019s dreams in its blooms.</p><p>The Dreaming Tree grew from a seed of the God-Willow, which towered over the ancient grove of Omikayalan. Cast loose when the God-Willow was tragically felled, the seed took root in what came to be known as the Garden of Forgetting. Nurtured by the Green Father, Ivern\u2014as many of the descendants of Omikayalan were\u2014the Dreaming Tree spiraled up, spreading the magic of humanity\u2019s desires each time the dream-laden buds bloomed.</p><p>Lillia was born when one of the tree\u2019s <i>own</i> dreams was captured in a bud that fell to the ground before it could bloom\u2014something that had never happened before. Sprouting into an awkward fawn creature with the flower bud still on her head, Lillia\u2019s only company was her mother tree, and the dreams that drifted to the garden each night.</p><p>Lillia helped tend the buds, and learned about humanity through them. Enchanted by the people and places she glimpsed, she spent every waking moment experiencing a swirl of emotions and desires that mortals could only see when they closed their eyes.</p><p>In caring for the dreams, Lillia also cared for the dreamers. She came to consider each of them a new friend, wanting nothing more than to one day greet the people who imagined such wonders. Lillia wanted it so badly that her own desires eventually gathered in a bud on the tree.</p><p>But when Lillia finally did meet humans, it wasn\u2019t like remembering a familiar dream. It was more like waking up.</p><p>Something was happening in the world outside Lillia\u2019s forest. War blazed like a fire through the land, and in time, fewer dreams began to reach the garden. The tree itself grew sick, and became infected with burls\u2014writhing tangles in its trunk, which oozed darkness.</p><p>Lillia did her best to nurture her mother tree and the dreams that remained in its buds, but it was not long before the garden became so weak that the violence of the world spilled in. One night, warriors entered the forest and chased a lone figure all the way to the Dreaming Tree. With a single errant blade\u2019s slash, the branch containing Lillia\u2019s unrealized dream came thudding to the ground.</p><p>Lillia panicked and forced them all to sleep, shocked at the difference between the mortals she thought she knew, and the ones she had found.</p><p>They were so afraid\u2014more tangle than sparkle. <i>They were like the burls</i>\u2026</p><p>But as the warriors slept and Lillia wept, a dream emerged from the lone figure the others had been chasing. Weakly, it floated toward the broken branch on the ground and moved into the bough\u2019s bud.</p><p>Lillia picked it up. She could feel the dream. As she whispered to it and soothed it, it glowed ever brighter\u2014and so did she. The bud upon her head unfurled, and magic swirled around like sparkling pollen. In that moment, swept up in possibility and wonder, Lillia herself bloomed\u2026 until, with a sneeze, she sent the magic curling into the surrounding forest.</p><p>The humans awoke one by one, unable to remember what had brought them to the forest, or what they had done. None noticed the timid fawn behind the tree. With relief, Lillia watched the humans go, still seeing only confusing tangles\u2014but knowing now that there was still a sparkle beneath it all.</p><p>And if their dreams wouldn\u2019t come to the tree, she would have to bring the tree to them.</p><p>Taking up her branch, Lillia left the garden and entered the world of humans\u2014a world she had always wanted to know, but one that frightened her now more than anything. It was so unlike what she understood.</p><p>Hiding just out of sight, Lillia now helps people\u2019s dreams be born, drawn forward by glimpses of who they could be, and by what may be trapped beneath their tangles. By helping humans realize their deepest wishes, Lillia realizes her own, the bud on her head blooming as she is filled with joy.</p><p>Though darkness may be encroaching on Ionia once more, it is but a mask, and beneath it lies the familiar sparkle of hope. Only by braving the world, and braving herself, can Lillia hope to untangle its burls.</p>",

The borders between the mortal realm and what lay beyond it were hotly contested.</p><p>Into this dangerous and volatile age, Lissandra and her sisters, Serylda and Avarosa, were born. Each sought to harness the powers at war, and each paid a terrible price. Attempting to command the heavens above them, Serylda lost her voice to the first twilight. Avarosa faced the twisting dark beneath the world, and was deafened by its emptiness, waiting to consume all creation.</p><p>It was Lissandra who stood against the wild magic of the mortal world itself. For this defiance, the savage claws of a primal god raked across her eyes, blinding her.</p><p>Though each sister had lost a part of themselves, it was on the frozen fields of Lissandra\u2019s many battles that they were able to unite and prevail. Together, they were unstoppable\u2026 but even a bond of blood could only weather so much.</p><p>With her sight taken, Lissandra chose instead to walk in dreams. As she navigated the fitful visions of those around her, she realized only she could see the darkness below for what it was: the lingering abyss promised not only an ending, but <i>infinity</i>. It was death, both dangerous and full of potential. Unknown to her sisters, Lissandra struck a deal on their behalf with the god-like entities she had communed with\u2014the Watchers would grant them near-immortality in exchange for preparing Runeterra for the coming of the Void.</p><p>The three sisters and their most powerful followers were named <i>Iceborn</i>. Those with this ability to withstand the worst of the numbing frost would be spared until the very end.</p><p>However, Lissandra\u2019s sisters grew displeased. Avarosa argued that the only thing worse than death was servitude. Even Serylda bristled against what would become of the world they had fought so hard for. Caught in the middle, Lissandra tried to soothe her sisters\u2019 concerns while appealing to the Watchers for more time, but the unknowable nothingness cared not for such platitudes.</p><p>The Void erupted into the mortal world in the far north, and with it, Lissandra\u2019s hidden allegiance to the Watchers became undeniable. In that moment, her only choices were to let all the world be consumed, or to give up what she cared for most\u2014Lissandra sacrificed her sisters and the allies they had gathered, entombing the Watchers beneath a glacial barrier of magical ice that could never be melted.</p><p>Lissandra soon discovered that even this elemental power was not enough. The monstrous beings she had frozen were merely slumbering, slowly tainting the True Ice around them into something darker. Now, they wandered through Lissandra\u2019s dreams as easily as she had theirs, and always she would wake, terrified, professing her loyalty to the chilling eternity they promised.</p><p>Ever the survivor, she gathered her remaining followers to venerate her and her departed sisters. If True Ice would delay the inevitable end of all things, then they had to gather as much of it as they could find, and scour the frozen lands for any of Iceborn descent to join their cause.</p><p>Lissandra and the first among her Frostguard did everything in their power to rewrite history, seizing all records of what had truly happened\u2026 and yet, rumors and prophecies persisted in myth and song. It was whispered that Avarosa and Serylda would one day return to unite the disparate tribes, and so Lissandra had any who were hailed as their reincarnations quietly killed. Even she retreated into the shadows, periodically renewing herself with the powers she had been gifted.</p><p>Like the threat that lies trapped beneath the ice, Lissandra has never been able to completely control her sisters\u2019 legends. Whether from guilt or arrogance, her failure to eradicate their legacy has manifested once more in two powerful Iceborn\u2014one an idealist, the other a conqueror\u2014and now, between them, they lead many tribes within the Freljord.</p><p>Lissandra watches them carefully, seeking any opportunity to pit them against one another, all the while redoubling her own efforts to lock away the terrible secrets she has buried deep under her citadel.</p><p>And she must hurry, for the ice is beginning to melt.<br></p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>As the reclusive leader of the Frostguard, many believe Lissandra is a living saint whose followers bring healing and wisdom to the tribes of the Freljord. The truth is perhaps more sinister, as she uses her elemental magic to twist the power of True Ice into something dark and terrible, entombing or impaling any who would reveal her deepest secrets. Indeed, the legacy of her past may yet be the beginning of the end for Runeterra.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>From an early age, Lucian wanted nothing more than to be like his father, Urias, who was a member of the ancient order of the Sentinels of Light. While Lucian remained home in Demacia, Urias ranged far and wide, protecting the living from the wraiths of the Black Mist. </p>\n<p>Urias would regale Lucian with tales of his adventures, where courage and ingenuity carried the day. Lucian hung on every word, picturing himself saving the people of Runeterra at his father\u2019s side. But Urias did not want his son to follow in his footsteps, hoping to keep his family safe from the dangerous life he had chosen.</p>\n<p>Lucian waited for the day he would become Urias\u2019 apprentice, but it never came.</p>\n<p>Instead, Lucian stayed in Demacia, where he found himself increasingly at odds with the kingdom\u2019s culture. It especially rankled him that Demacia would exile peaceful mages to the hinterlands. Lucian found fulfillment in safeguarding the banished on their perilous journey. Where his countrymen saw only outlaws, reducing the world to good or evil, Lucian looked closer, and saw people in need of help.</p>\n<p>After returning home from one such journey, Lucian found a stranger waiting at his door. She introduced herself as Senna, a Sentinel of Light. Cradling Urias\u2019 relic pistol in her hands, Senna explained that Lucian\u2019s father had died, falling in battle against the the long-dead wraiths of the Black Mist. </p>\n<p>Senna had been Urias\u2019 apprentice, fighting at his side for years.</p>\n<p>Lucian reeled in shock\u2014not only was his father dead, but before him stood a woman who had lived the life he had wanted for so long. As Senna made to take her leave, Lucian stopped her at the door, insisting he join her. He knew what came next\u2014the vigil for lost Sentinels. Senna reluctantly allowed Lucian to accompany her.</p>\n<p>Along the way, the two traded stories of their time with Urias, Senna comforting Lucian with her plainspoken wisdom, and Lucian easing her pain with fond remembrances. They arrived at Urias\u2019 birthplace, far away from Demacian lands. There, they held the vigil for lost Sentinels.</p>\n<p>As they prepared to depart, dark clouds rolled in over the coast, and wraiths manifested from the foulness, attacking them. Where Lucian was horrified, Senna drew her weapons with a grim familiarity\u2014this was her curse. Since she was a child, tendrils of the Black Mist had stalked her wherever she went, unleashing its horror should she tarry anywhere for too long.</p>\n<p>As Senna fought one of the creatures, it clawed Urias\u2019 pistol from her grip. Lucian retrieved it, sensing his fate opening up before him. The blazing sorrow in his heart manifested in a bolt of light that blasted from the pistol, distracting the wraith so Senna could banish it. Senna fought off the remaining spirits before the pair left, the Mist ever on her trail.</p>\n<p>Never before had one of the uninitiated fired a Sentinel\u2019s relic weapon. For the first time, Lucian had shown Senna his potential to join the order.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Senna entrusted Lucian with his father\u2019s pistol, and instructed him in the tactics and doctrines of the Sentinels. He proved himself worthy of the lessons. A bond slowly formed between them, Lucian\u2019s warmth and charm the perfect balance to Senna\u2019s discipline and unbreakable resolve. </p>\n<p>Lucian and Senna battled the myriad evils that ushered forth from the Black Mist, and their reliance upon each other blossomed into love. The closer Lucian grew to Senna, the more he witnessed the curse she bore. Each conflict hardened him, splitting the world apart into light and shadow, good and evil. Lucian\u2019s urge to heal Senna became a crusade he pursued with reckless zeal. </p>\n<p>Scouring a forgotten vault for a cure, the two Sentinels were attacked by the monstrous wraith Thresh. The ghoulish Chain Warden was a dangerous foe, and when Senna called to withdraw and regroup, Lucian refused to turn back. Throwing himself blindly into the attack, Lucian realized his mistake as Thresh gained the upper hand. Senna stepped into Thresh\u2019s path, imploring Lucian to run.</p>\n<p>As the dust settled, Senna lay dead before him, her soul claimed by Thresh\u2019s eldritch lantern.</p>\n<p>Senna\u2019s sacrifice was nearly Lucian\u2019s undoing. For years, he stalked Runeterra, a husk of the man he once was, his former warmth replaced with anger and bitterness. Wielding both his pistol and Senna\u2019s, Lucian hunted Thresh in the hope of destroying the lantern and granting oblivion to his captive love. On the day that battle finally came, Lucian shattered the lantern\u2014but instead of finding her eternal rest, Senna <em>reemerged.</em></p>\n<p>Lucian and Senna\u2019s love is a bond even death could not sever. As Lucian struggles to grasp Senna\u2019s altered form, he is forced to confront his own. Lucian now fights to return to his former self, while grappling with the reality that the dark forces he hates are all that keep Senna with him.</p>\n<p>While Senna has returned with knowledge of a new mission, Lucian remains obsessed with exacting vengeance from Thresh, as he is certain the Chain Warden\u2019s machinations have only begun.</p>",

After the wraith Thresh slew his wife, Lucian embarked on the path of vengeance\u2014but even with her return to life, his rage is undiminished. Merciless and single-minded, Lucian will stop at nothing to protect the living from the long-dead horrors of the Black Mist.</p>\n<p></p>",

One day, while wandering the material realm, she came upon what appeared to be a bird with a broken wing. She ran to help, at which point the bird turned into a tiny, mischievous fae spirit. Before she could react, the faerie grabbed her walking stick and took off. Giggling, Lulu gave chase.</p><p>The spirit led her far into the forest. They went over boulders, under logs, and around ancient, overgrown stone circles. The faerie darted into a cave hidden behind a waterfall, and Lulu went after it. It flittered ahead, always just out of reach.</p><p>Down and down and down they went. Lulu tumbled and scrambled around twisted roots and glowing mushrooms, and at some point they crossed over into the spirit realm without her realizing it. Their surroundings became progressively stranger and more disorienting; up became down, forward became backward, big became small.</p><p>Finally, after what seemed forever, Lulu caught up with the faerie, whose name, she discovered, was Pix.</p><p>With a click of his tiny fingers, Pix turned her humble walking stick into a spiraling staff, and tossed it back to her. It sprouted leaves and flowers, making Lulu gasp in delight. So began their forever-friendship, built of mischief, fun, and love of nature.</p><p>Pix had led her to the Glade. </p><p>Bandle City, Lulu\u2019s home, was a bizarre and magical place that defied logic, where time was meaningless and the natural laws of the material realm did not wholly apply. And yet the Glade was a place stranger still\u2014it existed long before yordles came into the world, and it was perhaps from the Glade that Bandle City itself sprung. A place of raw primordial magic, it was hidden away so deeply that no yordle had ever found it\u2026 until now.</p><p>Here, Lulu\u2019s own magic became wildly magnified. Laughing joyfully, she discovered she could reshape her surroundings at will, as well as alter her form to whatever she wanted. Everything and anything from her overactive imagination came to life. </p><p>Lulu didn\u2019t know if Pix had brought her here because he saw in her a kindred soul and simply wanted someone to play with, or if the Glade needed her for some other purpose\u2014but she fell in love with it instantly. Her life became one of endless creation and play, and she soon forgot anything else existed. </p><p>When finally she remembered, it was like waking from a dream.</p><p>She found herself back in the material realm, not knowing if a single day had passed, or a thousand years. To her surprise and joy, she found that some of her newfound power had come with her, allowing her to make small things large, change colors to those more pleasing to her, and cause creatures to fall spontaneously asleep. To Pix\u2019s endless amusement, she turned the mightiest beasts into tiny, bewildered frogs or squirrels with a flick of her staff.</p><p>Nevertheless, she began to miss the Glade. She decided to go back, but realized she didn\u2019t remember the way. Pix was no help, claiming to have forgotten as well, though it was possible he just didn\u2019t want to return quite yet. </p><p>Unperturbed, Lulu set out anyway. She was certain the route back to the Glade was always shifting, making one way as good as another. She simply picked whatever direction took her fancy at any particular moment, and even threw herself into seemingly terrible danger whenever it looked fun. Her travels took her far and wide, and magic, mayhem, and mishap tended to follow wherever she went.</p><p>In Demacia, she freed a group of children from their boring history lessons, and led them off into a nearby meadow. Her game resulted in them being turned into toadstools for a full turn of the moon, while their desperate parents and the local militia searched for them in vain. It wasn\u2019t quite what Lulu had intended, but fun nonetheless. When the children finally returned home and told everyone what had happened, no one believed them.</p><p>In the borderlands of the Freljord, Lulu thought it would be hilarious to change the weapons of two rival tribes into flowers just as they clashed, which resulted in absolute chaos and confusion. More recently, she has found herself happily lost in Ionia, playing in the glowing everblooms of Qaelin, and playing pranks on bewildered acolytes of the Order of Shadow, who she thinks are far too serious for their own good.</p><p>While Lulu seeks to return to the Glade, and misses it, she is happy, for every day brings more opportunity for adventure and fun. </p><p>And besides, she has come to realize that she carries a part of the Glade in her heart, wherever she goes.</p>",

They were born to the prestigious Crownguard family, which had served for generations as protectors of the kings of Demacia. Their grandfather saved the king\u2019s life at the Battle of Storm\u2019s Fang, and their aunt Tianna was named commander of the elite Dauntless Vanguard regiment before Lux was born.</p><p>Garen took to his family\u2019s role with fervor, joining the military when he was still little more than a boy. Lux, in his absence, was expected to help run the family\u2019s many estates\u2014a task she resented, even as a young child. She wanted to explore the world, to see what lay beyond the walls and borders of Demacia. She idolized Garen, but railed against his insistence that she put her own ambitions aside.</p><p>To the endless frustration of Lux\u2019s tutors, who sought to prepare her for a life of dutiful service to the Crownguard family, she would question their every teaching, examine differing perspectives, and seek out knowledge far beyond what they were prepared for. Even so, few could find it in themselves to stay angry at Lux, with her zest for life and intoxicating optimism.</p><p>Little did any of them know a time of change was approaching. Magic had once brought Runeterra to the brink of annihilation, and Demacia had been founded as a place where such powers were forbidden. Many of the kingdom\u2019s folktales told of pure hearts turned dark by the lure of magic. Indeed, Lux and Garen\u2019s uncle had been slain by a rogue mage some years earlier.</p><p>And there were fearful whispers, rumors from beyond the great mountains, that magic was rising once more in the world\u2026</p><p>Riding home one fateful night, Lux and her horse were attacked by a ravenous sabrewulf pack. In a moment of fear and desperation, the young girl let loose a torrent of magical light from deep within her, routing the beasts but leaving her shivering in fear. Magic, the terror of Demacian myths, was as much a part of Lux as her Crownguard lineage.</p><p>Fear and doubt gnawed at her. Would she become evil? Was she an abomination, to be imprisoned or exiled? At the very least, if her powers were discovered, it would see the Crownguard name disgraced forever.</p><p>With Garen spending more time away from High Silvermere, Lux found herself alone in the halls of their family home. Still, over time, she became more familiar with her magic, and her sleepless nights\u2014fists clenched, willing her inner light to fade\u2014became fewer and fewer. She began experimenting in secret, playing with sunbeams in the courtyards, bending them into solid form, and even creating tiny, glowing figures in her palm. She resolved to keep it a secret, as much as she could.</p><p>When she was sixteen, Lux traveled with her parents Pieter and Augatha to their formal residence in the Great City of Demacia, to witness Garen\u2019s investiture into the honored ranks of the Dauntless Vanguard.</p><p>The city dazzled Lux. It was a monument to the noble ideals of the kingdom, with every citizen protected and cared for; and it was there that Lux learned of the Illuminators, a charitable religious order working to help the sick and the poor. Between her family\u2019s courtly engagements, she became close with a knight of the order named Kahina, who also taught Lux more <i>martial</i> skills, sparring and training with her in the gardens of the Crownguard manor.</p><p>Spending more time in the capital, Lux has finally begun to learn about the wider world\u2014its diversity, and its history. She now understands that the Demacian way of life is not the only way, and with clear eyes she can see her love for her homeland standing alongside her desire to see it made more just\u2026 and perhaps a little more accepting of mages like her.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Luxanna Crownguard hails from Demacia, an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed with fear and suspicion. Able to bend light to her will, she grew up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to keep her power secret in order to preserve her family\u2019s noble status. Nonetheless, Lux\u2019s optimism and resilience have led her to embrace her unique talents, and she now seeks to bring greater tolerance and understanding to her homeland.",

The corruption spread rapidly from Icathia\u2019s ruins, boiling over the land and beneath the oceans, before its hideous tendrils reached the southernmost jungles of Ixtal.</p><p>Ne\u2019Zuk of the Ascended Host was an Ixtali elemental mage of colossal power, and almost unrivaled arrogance. He went before the emperor, pledging to create a weapon powerful enough to take the fight to the Void, and eradicate it at the source of its original eruption.</p><p>After months of inhuman labor, Ne\u2019Zuk revealed the Monolith\u2014a floating fortress of living stone, maintained by the greatest elemental mages, and its ramparts manned by his fellow Ixtali god-warriors. The size of a city itself, the Monolith glided titanically toward the wastelands of Icathia, the lightning crackling from its magical inhibitors fusing the sands to glass beneath it. Ne\u2019Zuk and his superweapon arrived at their destination, to face once more the howling infinite darkness of the abyssal realm, and the hordes of Voidborn monstrosities it had created.</p><p>The battle dragged into weeks. It was violence of a scale and intensity never before witnessed in Runeterra. Sorcery enough to raze entire civilizations, or render whole continents into naught but a memory, was unleashed upon the Void.</p><p>The darkness retaliated in kind. Its hideous energies gouged deep wounds into the living stone of the Monolith, whose surfaces became pocked and seared with unnatural <i>malphite</i>\u2014from the Ixtali for \u201cbad stone\u201d\u2014and leaving mineral-like scars. The fortress was pushed to the very limits of its design, struggling to self-repair and reknit its weakened superstructure\u2026 but even the incredible magics that held it aloft had a breaking point.</p><p>As Ne\u2019Zuk fought to rally his Ascended brethren for one last, desperate charge, the unthinkable happened. Sagging for an instant, the Monolith crashed down to earth, cleaving through the bedrock of Icathia and opening the Void beneath to the skies.</p><p>Much of the fortress was lost within that gaping maw, vanishing into the silent nothingness beyond. The rest rained down as great ruins, littering a landscape already blackened by the terrible conflict that had been cut so abruptly short. Only a single Ascended survived\u2014Ne\u2019Zuk hauled himself from the wreckage, choking on the ashes of what was meant to be his grandest triumph, now his greatest folly, and fled for his life.</p><p>In defiance of all worldly reason, some disparate fragments of the Monolith endured, still imbued with something like magical life. The far-flung shards struggled to heal, to reform the whole to which they had once belonged. But the Void\u2019s endless hunger leached away at them, rendering them as little more than inert shapes clawing feebly in the dust.</p><p>However, against all that had been lost, a single shard remained.</p><p>Buried deep beneath the surface, forgotten even by those that dwelt in the abyss, it slowly gathered in strength. It lived, until at last it awakened after uncounted centuries, and realized it was alone.</p><p>In all the centuries since that dark day, Malphite, the last shard of the Monolith, has become something of a legend in Runeterra. It has reputedly been sighted everywhere, from Targon to Zaun; heard sometimes as a tectonic roar in the deepest caverns, and sometimes as a quiet voice, humming to itself, that it might still remember the sounds of the world it once knew.</p><p>Despite the enormous span of its existence, the overwhelming drive enkindled by Ne\u2019Zuk\u2019s creation of the Monolith has not wavered. Now, Malphite knows it must soon rise to meet the resurgent darkness it once battled, as the Void awakens to threaten all of Runeterra once more.</p>",

The only son of aging trinket peddlers, Malzahar did not realize his gift until his parents had already succumbed to a wasting sickness, leaving the young, traumatized boy to fend for himself on the city streets of Amakra. He read fortunes in the gutter, for a coin or scraps of bread.<br> <br>As his auguries proved more and more accurate, his reputation grew. He used his second sight to predict who a curious cameleer might marry, or where throwing daggers would land in games of chance at the bazaar. Soon, he began to receive patrons dressed not in dirtied sandals, but jeweled slippers.<br> <br>However, for all this, Malzahar could never see his own destiny. His future was hidden.<br> <br>Increasingly disillusioned with his success, he noted the common disparities of wealth, and witnessed those unhappy with their lives acting out in spiteful violence against one another. It was apparent to him that people were bound up in a never-ending cycle of pain, often of their own making, and no hopeful prophecy seemed able to break it. Malzahar himself soon felt nothing but a sense of emptiness, finally relinquishing his mortal possessions and leaving Amakra for good.<br> <br>For years, he roamed the land, from the trackless wastes of the lesser <i>sai</i> to the ruins of old Shurima. By distancing himself from others, he was alone with his thoughts at last. He divined not just how callous people could be, but also how corrupt the world might yet become. Feverish visions began to plague his waking hours, along with otherworldly whispers of war and strife, and endless suffering.<br> <br>He wandered far, until the sands turned to salt. He could not know that he had arrived in Icathia, a lost city ravaged in the wars of a bygone age. There, gazing into the depths of a ragged abyss, Malzahar opened his unsteady mind, desperate for understanding.<br> <br>And the Void answered.<br> <br>That would have been the end of any other tale, and yet somehow Malzahar endured. What lay in the darkness below brushed against the soul of the broken seer, only for an instant, and yet its strange and unknowable energies saturated his mind completely.<br> <br>The lone figure that eventually strode out of Icathia was no longer just a man, but something greater. Malzahar had seen in the abyss an end to all the suffering he had witnessed in his mortal lifetime. He realized the future he had believed hidden from him all this time was in fact a vision of his true calling: to accelerate the world toward inevitable oblivion. He had to return to the people, and spread word of the holy nothingness that would gladly embrace them, the willing and non-believers alike. He would become the herald of the world\u2019s salvation.<br> <br>Among the nomads of the deep desert, he found his first disciples. Before their astonished eyes, he used his new Void-given powers to rend the very earth itself, summoning chittering, nightmarish creatures to carry away any who dared to deny him. Within a matter of months, strange rumors began to travel with the merchant caravans; rumors of men and women gladly sacrificing themselves to unseen powers, and of powerful quakes opening up the bedrock of Shurima in new fault lines hundreds of miles long.<br> <br>In the years since, Malzahar\u2019s legend has spread even to the northern ports. As followers of \u201cthe Prophet\u201d grow in number, nearby settlers are said to experience malefic visions grasping at their hearts, and fear gives rise to superstition\u2014even the hardy villagers of the far wastes now make offerings of livestock to appease the voidling creatures below.<br> <br>Little do they know, this only helps Malzahar in shepherding the coming of the end.</p>",

In the desert wastes of Shurima, he followed the voices that whispered in his mind, all the way to ancient Icathia. Amidst the ruins of that land, he gazed into the dark heart of the Void itself, and was gifted new power and purpose. Malzahar now sees himself as a shepherd, empowered to bring others into the fold\u2026 or to release the voidling creatures that dwell beneath.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Maokai is a rageful, towering treant who fights the unnatural horrors of the Shadow Isles. He was twisted into a force of vengeance after a magical cataclysm destroyed his home, surviving undeath only through the waters of life infused within his heartwood. Once a peaceful nature spirit, Maokai now furiously battles to banish the scourge of unlife from the Shadow Isles and restore his home to its former beauty.</p><p>Long before living memory, a chain of islands erupted from deep beneath the ocean tides as blank slates of rock and clay. With its creation, the nature spirit Maokai was born. He took the form of a treant, with his tall body covered in bark and long limbs resembling branches. Maokai felt the profound loneliness of the land and its potential for teeming growth. He wandered from island to island in search of signs of life, growing ever more forlorn in his solitude.</p><p>On a hilly isle covered in soft, rich soil, Maokai sensed a boundless energy radiating from deep beneath the ground. He plunged his great roots downward until they reached a spring of magical, life-giving water and drank deeply. From this potent liquid, he grew hundreds of saplings and planted them across the islands.</p><p>Soon the land was shawled with verdant forests, groves of towering virenpine, and tangled woods, all steeped in wondrous magic. Magnificent skytrees with expansive canopies and thickly winding roots covered the isles with lush green foliage. Nature spirits were drawn to the lavish vegetation, and animals reveled in the fertile greenery.</p><p>When humans eventually came to the islands, they too thrived in the land\u2019s abundance and formed an enlightened society of scholars devoted to studying the world\u2019s mysteries. Though Maokai was wary of their presence, he saw how they respected the sanctity of the land. Sensing the deep magic within the woods, the humans built their homes in areas not heavily forested, to avoid disturbing any nature spirits. Maokai occasionally revealed himself directly to those he trusted and blessed them with knowledge of the verdant isles, even its greatest gift \u2013 the underground spring that could heal mortal wounds.</p><p>Centuries passed, and Maokai lived in idyllic contentment until a fleet of soldiers from across the sea beached upon the shores of the isles. Maokai sensed something was terribly wrong. Their grief-maddened king bore the corpse of his queen and in hopes of reviving her, bathed her decayed flesh in the healing waters. Reanimated as a rotting corpse, the queen begged to return to death. The king sought to reverse what he had done, unwittingly casting a terrible curse upon the land.</p><p>From leagues away, Maokai felt the first ripples of the disaster that would soon devastate the isles. He sensed a horrific force gathering beneath the soil, and a bitter chill washed over him.</p><p>As the ruination spread, Maokai desperately plunged his roots deep into the ground and drank of the healing waters, saturating every fiber of his being with their magic. Before the cursed water reached him, Maokai withdrew his roots, severing all connection to the pool. He howled in rage as the sacred reservoir he had entrusted to men was fully corrupted \u2013 the spiraling coils churning underwater until nothing pure remained.</p><p>Moments later, the mists surrounding the islands blackened and spread over the land, trapping all living things in an unnatural state between life and death. Maokai watched in helpless agony as all he knew \u2013 plants, nature spirits, animals, and humans alike \u2013 twisted into wretched shades. His fury grew; the great beauty he had cultivated from tiny saplings fell to ruin in an instant at the careless hand of man.</p><p>The enervating mist coiled around Maokai, and he wept as the bright flowers adorning his shoulders crumbled and fell to dust. His body shuddered and contorted into a mass of gnarled roots and tangled branches as the mist leached life from him. But Maokai\u2019s heartwood was saturated with the precious waters of life, saving him from the terrible fate of undeath.</p><p>As grotesque wraiths and horrific abominations flooded the land, Maokai was overcome by a host of lifeless men. He struck the spirits with his branchlike limbs in manic violence, realizing the force of his blows could shatter them to dust. Maokai shuddered with revulsion: he had never killed before. He flew at the breathless shapes in a frenzy, but hundreds more overwhelmed him, and eventually he was forced to retreat.</p><p>With his home all but decimated and his companions turned to deathless horrors, Maokai was tempted to try and escape the nightmare of the isles. But from deep within his twisted form, he felt the sacred waters giving him life. He had survived the Ruination by carrying the very heart of the islands within him, and he would not abandon his home now. As the Blessed Isles\u2019 first nature spirit, he would remain and fight for the soul of the land.</p><p>Though surrounded by endless hosts of malicious foes and darkening mist, Maokai fights with furious vengeance to conquer the evil that plagues the isles. His only pleasure comes from dealing savage violence to the soulless wraiths who roam his land.</p><p>Some days, Maokai subdues the mist and its deathless spirits, breaking their hold on a grove of trees or a small thicket. Though new life has not bloomed in such cursed soil for an age, Maokai strives to carve havens, however temporary, free from regret and decay.</p><p>So long as Maokai continues to fight, hope remains, for steeped within his heartwood are the uncorrupted waters of life, the last remaining chance of restoring the isles. If the land returns to its joyous state, Maokai, too, will shed his twisted form. The nature spirit brought life to these isles long ago, and he refuses to rest until the isles bloom once more.</p>",

Here, in the village of Wuju, the boy Yi grew up learning the ways of the sword, chasing a dream that later turned to tragedy.</p><p>Like most children, he admired those who wore silk robes and carried blades with poems to their name. His parents being swordsmiths, Yi made a strong impression on the local warriors who frequented their workshop. He spent his mornings in the garden, sparring with his mother, and his nights reciting poetry to his father by candlelight. When it came time for Yi to study under Wuju\u2019s masters, his parents could not have been prouder.</p><p>Carrying his talent and discipline over to his training, he surpassed every expectation. Soon, the whole village knew of the \u201cYoung Master\u201d Yi.</p><p>Still, the humble student wondered about the rest of Ionia. From atop the tallest pagodas, he spotted faraway towns no one else ever mentioned, but when he sought to journey down the mountain with blade in hand, his mentors forbade him. Wuju was founded by those believing their swordsmanship to be too precious to share, too sacred to draw blood\u2014so for centuries, it flourished in isolation, with no outsiders knowing its true nature. </p><p>All this changed the day Yi saw vast plumes of smoke rising above the distant towns. Noxian warbands had invaded from the coast, conquering settlement after settlement in waves that washed the provinces red. Choosing the people of Ionia over Wuju\u2019s hallowed tradition, Yi ventured down to help defend the First Lands. To astonished eyes, he swept across the front lines in a blur, routing the enemy with blinding swordplay never before seen by outsiders.</p><p>Word of the one-man army spread far and wide, like mist in the mountains. Inspired by his courage, even his fellow disciples joined the fight, and together they journeyed to Navori where the greater war was raging.</p><p>The Noxian commanders saw in Wuju a threat that could not be ignored. They scouted the origin of these peerless warriors, and elected to strike at their home without mercy. In a single night, the entire village was destroyed, its people and culture obliterated by chemical fire that no steel could hold back.</p><p>After the war finally ended, Yi returned as the only surviving disciple, to find nothing but ruins. The very magic of the land had been defiled, and everyone he had known and loved was no more. Slain in spirit, if not in body, Yi became the attack\u2019s final casualty. With no other practitioners of Wuju left alive, he realized the title of master was his to bear alone.</p><p>Grief-stricken, he chose seclusion, training obsessively to bury the guilt of his survival, but the wisdom of bygone masters seemed to fade with the haze of time. He began to doubt if one man could preserve an entire heritage\u2026 until he encountered the least expected of individuals.</p><p>A curious, monkey-like vastaya challenged him to a duel. Reluctantly, Master Yi entertained the creature\u2019s demands, defeating him with ease.

For the first time in years, Yi felt the spirit of Wuju once more.</p><p>The two clashed for weeks, until the bruised stranger finally knelt on the ground and introduced himself as Kong, of the Shimon tribe. He begged to learn from Yi, who saw in this reckless but determined fighter the makings of a new disciple. Through teaching, Yi found his purpose restored. He would pass on the ways of Wuju, and gifted his pupil an enchanted staff and an honorific as a sign of this vow\u2014from that day onward, Kong was known as Wukong.</p><p>Together, they now travel the First Lands, as Yi seeks to honor the legacy of his lost home, allowing him to fully embody the \u201cmaster\u201d in his name.<br></p>",

Her mother\u2019s skill in crafting firearms was legendary, and her bespoke handguns were to be found in the collections of many a wealthy merchant captain.</p><p>But oft-times, they were coveted by those with more meager means, and darker hearts.</p><p>One such individual was an up-and-coming Bilgewater reaver, known to his crew as Gangplank. Cocksure and certain of his power, he demanded a pair of Fortune pistols the like of which no other man could hope to possess. A reluctant deal was struck, and a year later to the day, Gangplank returned. With no intention of paying for the work, he had masked his face with a grimy scarf. He was there to take the guns by force.</p><p>Abigale had crafted two masterpieces, twin hand cannons of exquisite workmanship and pinpoint lethality\u2014indeed, she declared, too fine for the likes of him. She could see the brutish thug that Gangplank had become. Enraged, he seized the pistols and gunned her down with her own creations before turning them on her husband, and young Sarah too. Then, out of nothing but spite, he set the workshop ablaze and smashed both pistols on the cobblestones, to wipe the Fortune legacy from the face of Runeterra completely.</p><p>Sarah awoke to agony. Her wounds were grave, but she managed to crawl from the burning ruins with the remains of the two pistols clutched to her chest. In time, her body healed, but waking nightmares and night terrors would torment her for many years to come.</p><p>Even so, she endured. She was determined to have vengeance. She rebuilt her mother\u2019s pistols, and learned all she could of the masked murderer who had since declared himself the new reaver king of Bilgewater, and forced even the most influential ship captains to honor his claim.</p><p>No matter. When Sarah faced him again, she would be ready.</p><p>Taking a ship to Bilgewater Bay, she killed her first man within minutes of setting foot on the crooked timbers of the quayside\u2014a drunken pirate with a gallon of Myron\u2019s Dark in his belly, and a price on his head. Sarah dragged his corpse to the bounty board officials, before tearing off a dozen more warrants and heading off into the city.</p><p>Within a week, every one of them was settled, and those with the misfortune to be hunted by Sarah were either dead or in chains. She quickly earned a reputation in the taverns and gambling dens, becoming known only as \u201cMiss Fortune\u201d. Gangplank would never see her coming. What was one more bounty hunter on the streets of his city?</p><p>In the years that followed, tales of Miss Fortune\u2019s exploits spread far and wide, each more fanciful than the last. She drowned the leader of the Silk-Knife Corsairs in a barrel of her own stolen rum. She took the <i>Syren</i> from a captain who learned the hard way what it meant to slip a hand where it wasn\u2019t wanted. She tracked the insane Doxy-Ripper to his lair in the belly of a half-dismembered leviathan down on the slaughter docks, and shot him in the back as he fled.</p><p>In spite of all this, Gangplank was far too powerful to confront openly, with the fierce Jagged Hooks crew always at his side\u2014but Miss Fortune knew just killing him would never be enough. Only his abject humiliation, and the burning to ash of all he had stolen, would satisfy the girl who had died on the floor of her mother\u2019s workshop.</p><p>And so, little by little, she began to surround herself with a small but loyal cadre of allies that would eventually help her lay her demons to rest.</p><p>Miss Fortune risked everything to make her move against Gangplank. Plots within plots saw his ship, the <i>Dead Pool</i>, blown to flaming wreckage in the harbor, and the tyrannical reaver king overthrown. Best of all, everyone in Bilgewater saw him fall. It was everything Sarah could have hoped for, exactly as she\u2019d planned.</p><p>And it was over in moments.</p><p>With Gangplank gone, the other rival captains quickly descended into fighting amongst themselves for control of the city. What little semblance of law there had been was gone in an instant, with countless innocent civilians caught between the warring crews. Reluctantly, Miss Fortune stepped up\u2014as captain of the <i>Syren</i>, and backed by her own people, she brokered an uneasy truce that has somehow held to this day.</p><p>But little is ever really permanent in the port city, and Captain Fortune still finds herself having to impose her own brand of order on every reaver, ganglord, and distant threat that comes her way.</p><p>The real battle for Bilgewater has only just begun.</p>",
                "lore_short": "A Bilgewater captain famed for her looks but feared for her ruthlessness, Sarah Fortune paints a stark figure among the hardened criminals of the port city. As a child, she witnessed the reaver king Gangplank murder her family\u2014an act she brutally avenged years later, blowing up his flagship while he was still aboard. Those who underestimate her will face a beguiling and unpredictable opponent\u2026 and, likely, a bullet or two in their guts.",

But\n    after Lun\u00e9 was caught plotting against the Yun Tal, both sisters were convicted of her crime and punished as twins.\n    Lup\u00e9 was banished to the farthest reaches of Ixtal and Lun\u00e9 all but vanished, taking with her the last of Lup\u00e9's\n    trust.</p>\n<p>By the time Milio was born, his family had done all they could to make the best of their new lives. He knew only love\n    and laughter, and to him, life in the village was paradise\u2014what more could they ever need?</p>\n<p>When Milio was old enough, Lup\u00e9 tried to teach her grandson the axiomata. Where the rest of her family had failed\n    her, Milio showed promise and took to the elements naturally, but struggled to grasp the rules and rigidity of the\n    discipline. Disappointed, Lup\u00e9 gave up hope, abandoning Milio's teachings.</p>\n<p>Milio, however, continued to learn on his own. Away from the guidance of his grandmother, he abandoned the\n    restrictions she had tried to impose on him. Studying nature itself, he intuited his own set of rules and eventually\n    mastered fire\u2014the one axiom his grandmother wouldn't teach him.</p>\n<p>But something bothered Milio about fire. Did it have to be so destructive, especially when he saw the potential for\n    it to do more?</p>\n<p>The answer revealed itself one night while Milio was chasing the glow of summer fireflies. They led him to one of the\n    village\u2019s hunters who was injured and unable to move. Milio tried to keep her stable with his fire axiom, but it\n    wasn't enough. Knowing the village healer was too far, he tried desperately to adapt the axiom into a force that\n    could heal.</p>\n<p>As he placed his hands on the hunter's stomach to support her wound, he felt a flicker of warmth.. It was so familiar\n    and soothing, like he was touching her soul. Her <em>inner flame. </em>Then Milio began to feel that same flame\n    within himself. He could feel it within the trees, within the leaves\u2014as if each part of the jungle was coming to\n    life like a cozy bonfire.</p>\n<p>Focusing all of his energy into that feeling, he used what nature had taught him to manifest that fire. What emerged\n    was a creature\u2014small and timid with wide, friendly eyes. Milio placed it on the hunter's wound and felt the\n    creature\u2014his inner flame\u2014heal her from the inside out.</p>\n<p>That night, he\u2019d discovered an entirely new axiom, which he affectionately named \u201csoothing fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milio ran home to show his family what he'd done. Before their eyes, he manifested another soothing flame that danced\n    happily in the palm of his hand\u2014his \"fuemigo\"\u2014and his family celebrated.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Lup\u00e9, however, was unsettled by this achievement.</p>\n<p>Seeing Milio\u2019s mastery of the axiomata at such a young age, Lup\u00e9 knew that her grandson had done what the rest of her\n    family failed to do. With his abilities, he could finally end their exile and restore them to their rightful place\n    among Ixtal's ruling caste. However, she was troubled by his fascination with fire and how his burgeoning skills\n    went against the traditional teachings of the axiomata.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Lup\u00e9 threw everything into her last chance at redemption. Milio became her sole focus as she nurtured\n    and shaped his abilities, preparing him to leave home, travel to Ixaocan, and finally free her from the burden of\n    her sister's failures. Milio felt this weight upon his shoulders, and the thought of leaving home on his own\n    terrified him. But because Milio loved his family more than anything, he would find the courage if it meant ensuring\n    their happiness.</p>\n<p>In preparation for the journey, he and his grandmother fashioned a special backpack that Milio called his\n    \"furnasita,\" inside of which he could keep his ever-burning fuemigo. Then, with a heavy heart and a wide smile,\n    Milio\u2014at only twelve years old\u2014left his village behind, outfitted with only his trusty furnasita and some new\n    clothes made by his family.</p>\n<p>He traveled the entirety of Ixtal, forging his way through the jungle, camping underneath the stars, and making\n    friends along the way, all while sending frequent letters home that detailed his exciting adventures. After a long\n    journey, Milio finally made it to Ixaocan, where he's since begun his training to challenge the Vidalion.</p>\n<p>\"The boy with the soothing flames\" has caught the eye of more than a few\u2014including Lun\u00e9, currently imprisoned beneath\n    the city and biding her time. Even Milio notices the whispering that accompanies him around the city, but his focus\n    is on joining the Yun Tal and making his family proud.</p>",

Having traveled through the Ixtal jungles to the capital of Ixaocan, Milio now prepares to face the Vidalion and join the Yun Tal, unaware of the trials\u2014and dangers\u2014that await him.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>In a previous epoch, the fierce warlord Sahn-Uzal rampaged across the northern wildlands. Driven by dark faith, he crushed every tribe and settlement in his path, forging an empire in blood and death. As his mortal life neared its end, he took great satisfaction in knowing he had doubtless earned a seat at the gods\u2019 table, in the glorious Hall of Bones, for all eternity.</p><p>Yet, when he died, he found no halls or glory awaiting him. Instead, Sahn-Uzal stood in an empty, gray wasteland, shrouded by ethereal fog and plagued by discordant whispers. Occasionally, other lost souls drifted nearby\u2014little more than ghostly shapes, wandering their own personal oblivion.</p><p>Anger consumed Sahn-Uzal. Had his faith been false? Or was his domination of the world simply not enough to grant him the immortality he craved? Surely this emptiness could not be all there was\u2026 yet there seemed no end to it. He watched as the lesser spirits slowly faded into the fog, unmade and lost to time.</p><p>But Sahn-Uzal refused to fade.</p><p>His will, tempered by rage and torment, held him together. Over time, the unknowable, disembodied whispering in that place crystalized into words he could almost comprehend\u2014this, he learned, was <i>Ochnun</i>, a profane tongue unspoken by any among the living. Slowly, a deceitful plan began to form in what was left of Sahn-Uzal\u2019s mind. He began to whisper temptations across the veil between realms, promising his indomitable strength to any who dared listen.</p><p>And, sure enough, the day came when a coven of sorcerers resolved to bring Sahn-Uzal back from the dead. Lacking any flesh or bone, he spurred them to make him stronger than any mortal, binding his spirit-form in dark metal plates wrought in the likeness of his old armor. So he rose, a hulking revenant of iron and hate.</p><p>These power-hungry sorcerers had hoped to use him as a weapon in their trivial wars. Instead, he slew them where they stood, their weapons and magic useless against him.</p><p>In desperation, they screamed out his name to bind him\u2014but to no avail, for Sahn-Uzal was no more.</p><p>With an ethereal rumble, he spoke his spirit-name in Ochnun: <i>Mordekaiser</i>.</p><p>Thus began his second conquest of the mortal realm. As before, his ambitions were great, only now empowered by necromantic sorceries he could never have previously imagined. From the fearful, dissipating souls of the sorcerers, Mordekaiser forged a weapon fit for an emperor of death\u2014his brutal mace, Nightfall\u2014and seized control of the army they had raised.</p><p>To his foes, it seemed he cared only for massacre and destruction. Entire generations perished under his relentless campaigns.</p><p>However, there was far more to Mordekaiser\u2019s plan. He raised the Immortal Bastion at the center of his empire; while most assumed it was merely a seat of power, some came to know the secrets it held. Mordekaiser hungered for all the forbidden knowledge of spirits and death, and a true understanding of the realm\u2026 or <i>realms</i>\u2026 beyond.</p><p>Such tyranny could only bring him enemies. The Iron Revenant was defeated, surprisingly, by an alliance of the Noxii tribes, and betrayal from within his own inner circle. This hidden cabal managed to sever the anchors of his soul from his armor, and sealed the empty iron shell away in a secret place.</p><p>And so, Mordekaiser was cast out of the material realm. However, unbeknownst to anyone, he had planned for this\u2014indeed, it was a pivotal part of his design. Domination and deceit had carried him far, but he knew that a destiny far grander than the Hall of Bones awaited him.</p><p>There, in the once empty wasteland, all those who had died under his latest reign were waiting. Perverted by dark sorcery, their spirits would never fade. The strongest became his devout, eternal army, bound to his will\u2026 but even the weak were given purpose.</p><p>From the subtle matter of their souls, Mordekaiser would forge a new empire. They would be the building blocks and mortar of his Afterworld.</p><p>Centuries have passed on Runeterra, and another empire has arisen around the Immortal Bastion. Mordekaiser\u2019s name is still whispered in fear and awe by those who study the old histories, and remembered unkindly by the few ancient souls who knew him. For them, the greatest terror would be for Mordekaiser to find his own way to return permanently.</p><p>It is something they pray will not come to pass, for they know of no way to stop him.</p>",

Few now remain who remember his earlier conquests, or know the true extent of his powers\u2014but there are some ancient souls that do, and they fear the day when he may return to claim dominion over both the living and the dead.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Whether through destiny or circumstance, Morgana and her sister were born to a world in conflict. The cataclysmic Rune Wars had ripped through most of Valoran and Shurima, and seemed poised to engulf even the peaks of Targon. Morgana\u2019s parents, Mihira and Kilam, knew the legends of the great mountain granting divine power\u2014they saw no other choice than to attempt the long and perilous journey, if their tribe was to be saved.</p><p>Even when they learned Mihira was with child, they could not turn back. Finally, where Runeterra touches the stars, Kilam watched in wonder and fear as Mihira was chosen to embody the Aspect of Justice.</p><p>The couple returned not only with the salvation they sought, but twin daughters\u2014Morgana and Kayle. However, the celestial power that claimed Mihira began to overshadow her mortal personality and affections. She would often push the girls into their father\u2019s arms, abandoning them to answer battle\u2019s call.</p><p>For many months, uncertainty gnawed at Kilam. The wars still raged on countless fronts, and his beloved wife was slipping away. Fearing for his daughters\u2019 safety, he waited for Mihira to leave once more, then fled Targon with them both.</p><p>Though their destination did not yet have a name, it would become known as a haven from magic and persecution: the kingdom of Demacia.</p><p>There the twins grew different as day and night. While Kayle studied the settlement\u2019s growing set of laws, dark-haired Morgana became troubled by their distrust of new arrivals. Knowing what it was to be a refugee, she wandered the wilds, talking to wayward mages and others cast out for the dangers they might bring. At home, she felt her father\u2019s heartbreak at leaving Mihira behind, and grew bitter at her mother for causing such pain.</p><p>Morgana\u2019s fears that she and Kayle might carry some remnant of the Aspect\u2019s power were eventually confirmed, when a great blade wreathed in shadow and starfire fell from the heavens. As it pierced the ground, splitting in two, feathered wings burst from the girls\u2019 shoulders. Their father wept at the sight of them each taking up half of the weapon, and turned away even as Morgana reached out to comfort him.</p><p>While Kayle embraced their new calling, rallying an order of judicators to enforce the laws, Morgana resented her gifts\u2026 until the night their settlement was raided. Kilam found himself surrounded as the fighting spread. In that moment, Morgana rushed to shield him, burning his attackers to ash. Together, the sisters saved countless lives, and were hailed as the Winged Protectors of Demacia.</p><p>But Kayle grew more extreme in her ideologies, and Morgana increasingly found herself pleading the case of those who wanted to atone for their crimes. An accord was struck between the sisters and their mortal devotees\u2014though it was uneasy, and did not last. Kayle\u2019s most ardent disciple, Ronas, came to arrest Morgana herself. Attempting to protect her penitent followers, she shackled him with dark flame until he fell to the floor, dead.</p><p>Divine fire lit the city from above as Kayle swore to bring Ronas\u2019 killer to justice, and Morgana met her sister in the skies.</p><p>They raised their blades, each matching the other with arcs of blinding light and burning darkness that lashed down at the buildings beneath them. It seemed certain that one of them would win\u2026 but Morgana faltered when she heard their father\u2019s anguished voice. Kilam lay in the rubble, mortally wounded. Howling with grief, Morgana hurled her half of their mother\u2019s sword at Kayle, and plunged to the surface like a meteorite.</p><p>She cradled her father, cursing their inheritance for the destruction around them. Kayle landed, dumbstruck, and Morgana demanded to know if the smiting of wicked mortals included Kilam, whose crime was stealing them away from their mother. Kayle gave no answer, but soared into the heavens without looking back.</p><p>Morgana\u2019s wings became an inescapable reminder of her pain. She tried to cut them from her flesh, but could find no blade strong enough. Instead, she bound them with iron chains, resolving instead to walk the world of mortals.</p><p>Over the centuries, her tale fell into myth, and the name Morgana was all but forgotten. To this day, the people of Demacia venerate \u201cthe Winged Protector,\u201d but recall only the glory and truth of one sister, while Morgana\u2019s dark outbursts and belief in personal redemption became the mysteries of \u201cthe Veiled One.\u201d</p><p>Through all of this, she still refuses to abandon those who would seek her aid. Bitter, betrayed, she bides her time in the kingdom\u2019s shadows, knowing with certainty that Kayle\u2019s light will someday return to Runeterra, and all will face her judgment.</p><p>As magic begins to rise again, Morgana sees that dawn is nearly upon them.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Conflicted between her celestial and mortal natures, Morgana bound her wings to embrace humanity, and inflicts her pain and bitterness upon the dishonest and the corrupt. She rejects laws and traditions she believes are unjust, and fights for truth from the shadows of Demacia\u2014even as others seek to repress it\u2014by casting shields and chains of dark fire. More than anything else, Morgana truly believes that even the banished and outcast may one day rise again.",

                "lore_full": "<p>In the pitch black Shuriman night, few sounds are as terrifying as the howls of the dune hound. Those who hear their piercing call on the arid wind know to keep a hand on their sword hilt, and their horse well rested, for the ravenous packs that rove these sands will chase whatever game they can find in their desert.</p>\n\n<p>One pack, in particular, is driven by a hunger that is deeper\u2014and more ancient\u2014than that of any mere beast. It is the hunger of a creature who spent ages eating nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>For centuries, Naafiri remained in a crypt, her spirit bound to an ancient throwing dagger. Unable to move or speak, the weapon lay inert as her soul pondered the past: Naafiri was powerful, having almost led the Darkin. How easily she could have bested any of them in combat to become their rightful ruler... yet how easily she\u2019d been tricked by that awful Aspect, Myisha, and cursed to embody these inanimate steel blades.</p>\n\n<p>Shame and regret consumed her thoughts. If she could get another chance... If she could only find another host. A new vessel.</p>\n\n<p>All she needed was a hand to grip her blade. <em>Just a touch.</em></p>\n\n<p>At last, the day came when the doors of her tomb burst open. She sensed the sweet relief of a fresh desert wind\u2014her first in ages\u2014and something else... A human presence.</p>\n\n<p><em>He has come. My host. My sweet, unwitting vessel</em>, thought the Darkin soul.</p>\n\n<p>But the visitor was aware of her magic. He carefully picked up her dagger with metal tongs and placed it onto a thick, lead-lined cloth. Wrapping the blade tightly, he took great care not to touch it and set off across the desert under the late afternoon sun.</p>\n\n<p>Despair overcame Naafiri as she felt the plodding movements of the man\u2019s horse across the sands. Was she doomed to this form, this waking nightmare of impotence, <em>for eternity</em>?</p>\n\n<p>She felt the steps of the horse quickening as sunset approached and sensed the distant howls of the dune hounds carried by the wind.</p>\n\n<p>This was her opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Without sound or words, the Darkin called out to the beasts, hoping to bring them to this prey\u2014that he might somehow slip. Just a glancing touch of his hand, and the host would be hers. Then she could use him to fulfill the ambitions she had held for so long, and vanquish her regrets.</p>\n\n<p>The hounds appeared, salivating with teeth bared. Naafiri\u2019s captor clung to the wrapped dagger with one arm, keenly aware of what would happen if it came loose. With his other arm, he drew his sword and attempted to defend himself from the pack.</p>\n\n<p>Jaws snapped at the man and his horse from all sides, tearing at them, devouring them piece by piece until nothing remained.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naafiri felt the world crash into focus as she became overwhelmed by senses. For the first time in ages, she smelled the dry air, which parched her nostrils. The metallic taste of hot blood still coated her mouth. She could see each of the dogs as if from the eyes of a separate packmate.</p>\n\n\n<p>Confusion set in as she felt her sense of self crumble away. She had become the dune hounds\u2014not one of them, but the entire pack\u2014her shattered consciousness resonating throughout the body of each dog.</p>\n\n\n<p>It seemed a cruel irony. She had found not one vessel, but dozens, and none of them were useful in her grand ambitions. She resented the hounds\u2014hated their smell, their fleas, and, most of all, their need for companionship.</p>\n\n<p>But, in time, the Darkin\u2019s bitterness subsided as she began to grasp the true nature of her hosts. Though feral, their collective thoughts formed a wisdom all its own. Separately, the dogs would starve. Together, they were an apex predator, feasting on whatever game they fancied. There were no individuals\u2014the pack was the entity that dominated all.</p>\n\n<p>Naafiri realized this concept was not limited to dune hounds. It applied to fish, ants, and humans. <em>It even applied to Darkin.</em></p>\n\n<p>She thought again of her past: personal grudges and petty agendas tearing the Darkin asunder, which in turn toppled them from their rightful place as the regnant killers of Runeterra.</p>\n\n<p>She knew how to restore them. Now she just needed to find her siblings and share with them the wisdom of the pack.</p>\n\n",

The first of her kind to leave the ocean and venture onto dry land, Nami faces the unthinkable with grit, determination, and daring mettle.</p><p>In the seas to the west of Mount Targon dwells a tribe of vastaya known as the Marai. Long ago, these mermadic creatures discovered a rift in the depths. The rift bore a horrible, creeping darkness which sought to exterminate all forms of life. </p><p>At the center of their village, the Marai placed a glowing rock known as a moonstone, which is said to be infused with the celestial magic of the heavens. Its haunting, ethereal light protects the Marai from the creatures that crawl from the abyss. Every hundred years or so, the moonstone\u2019s light begins to dim. At that moment, the tribe chooses their fiercest warrior and bestows upon them the title of Tidecaller. </p><p>The Tidecaller must plunge into the icy darkness of the rift, survive the horrors within and retrieve an abyssal pearl. If successful, the Tidecaller rises to shore where a luminous wanderer from Targon\u2019s peak awaits with a moonstone to trade for the pearl. It is an arduous ritual that holds the fate of many in its illusive hands, but the exchange has kept the creatures of the dark contained. In the past, the Marai had sent troops of their most elite warriors to collect the pearl, but they learned the more forces they sent into the rift, the stronger the monsters became, as if it fed on their energy. While an army would be annihilated by the abominations below, a single scout \u2013 armed with a legendary Marai staff capable of controlling the tides \u2013 could potentially elude the dangers of the deep long enough to escape with the pearl. </p><p>Nami had always wanted to be the Tidecaller, but she was impulsive and young. A fierce fighter, she was known amongst the Marai for her stubborn determination, which often got her in trouble. In Nami\u2019s adolescence, the moonstone once again dimmed for the first time in a century. Nami attempted the trial of the Tidecaller. Due to her impulsiveness, however, the elders chose Rasho, a prudent warrior known for his level head in battle, as their Tidecaller.</p><p>Rasho dove into the depths of the abyss. A week passed, then another. An entire month the Marai waited for their Tidecaller\u2019s return, but there was no sign of Rasho. No Tidecaller had ever failed to return.</p><p>The elders waited and argued while the moonstone grew faint, but Nami knew SOMEONE had to take up the mantle of Tidecaller soon, or all would be lost.</p><p>It might as well be her.</p><p>Nami grabbed her mother\u2019s bathystaff and plunged into the abyss. After several days, she returned with the pearl, the fallen Tidecaller\u2019s staff, and a look of quiet horror in her eyes. Though furious at her impertinence, the village elders nonetheless admired Nami\u2019s bravery and officially designated her Tidecaller. Nami ascended to the surface and rode the tide to shore to meet the landwalker.</p><p>The stonebearer, however, was nowhere to be found. Instead, an elderly woman waited on the beach. </p><p>The woman, whose grandparents bore witness to the last Tidecaller exchange, explained that there was no moonstone. The Aspect of the Moon was the only being who could conjure a moonstone, but she had fled Targon. </p><p>Nami was unwilling to accept this. She vowed to find the Aspect and retrieve the moonstone. The lives of her people depended on it.</p><p>Using the power of the mystical Tidecaller staff to summon a perpetual pool of moving water beneath her fins, Nami took to land to continue her quest.</p><p>Determined, the Tidecaller swam into a brand new world.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Nasus\u2019 brilliance was recognized long before he was chosen to join the ranks of the Ascended. A voracious student, he memorized and critiqued the greatest works of Shuriman history and philosophy before he was ten.</p><p>However, his passion was not shared by his younger brother Renekton, who tended to bore quickly, and fight with other local children instead. Nonetheless, the brothers were close, and Nasus kept an eye on Renekton, ensuring he didn\u2019t get into <i>too</i> much trouble.</p><p>When he came of age, Nasus was welcomed into the prestigious and exclusive Collegium of the Sun. He had the best teachers in the empire, and developed a keen understanding of military strategy and logistics, eventually becoming the youngest general in history. While a competent soldier, his genius lay not in fighting battles, but in planning them.</p><p>A deeply empathetic man, Nasus took his responsibilities seriously, always ensuring his soldiers were well provisioned, paid on time, and treated fairly. He guided the emperor\u2019s mortal armies to countless victories, and was respected by all who served beneath him. Sure enough, his brother Renekton also entered military service, and rose through the ranks as a trusted and capable warrior under Nasus\u2019 command.</p><p>But despite his triumphs and accolades, Nasus did not enjoy war. He understood its importance\u2014for now, at least\u2014in the empire\u2019s rapid expansion, yet firmly believed his greatest contribution to Shurima was the knowledge they could gather and preserve in the wake of each conquest. At his urging, all the books, scrolls, and teachings of the cultures they defeated were added to libraries and repositories throughout the empire, to bring wisdom and enlightenment to generations still to come.</p><p>After decades of dutiful service, Nasus was cruelly struck by a terrible wasting sickness, and his physician solemnly declared that the general would be dead within a week.</p><p>The people of Shurima were bereft, for Nasus was their brightest star and beloved by all. The emperor himself pleaded with Setaka of the Ascended Host for the great man\u2019s deeds to be weighed before the Sun Disc.</p><p>After a day and night, Setaka\u2019s emissaries confirmed that Nasus would be blessed with Ascension. He would have to undergo the rituals at once, despite his infirmity.</p><p>Renekton, now a warleader in his own right, raced home to be with his brother. He was shocked to find Nasus\u2019 flesh wasted away, his bones fragile as glass. So weak was he that, as Sun Disc\u2019s golden radiance streamed over the dais, Nasus was unable to climb the final steps into its light.</p><p>Renekton\u2019s love for his brother was stronger than any sense of self-preservation. He carried the weakly protesting Nasus onto the dais, and would willingly accept oblivion.</p><p>However, Renekton was not destroyed as expected. When the light faded, not one but <i>two</i> god-warriors emerged\u2014both brothers had not only survived, but flourished. Nasus stood as a towering, jackal-headed avatar of wisdom and strength, while Renekton was a muscled behemoth in the likeness of a crocodile.</p><p>Nasus had been gifted powers far beyond mortal understanding. The greatest boon of his Ascension was the countless lifetimes he could now spend in study and contemplation... though this would also eventually come to be his greatest curse.</p><p>But he was more immediately concerned by the increased savagery he saw within Renekton. At the siege of Nashramae, finally bringing the city under Shuriman rule, Nasus learned that his brother had razed the grand library and massacred all who stood against him. This was the closest the brothers ever came to bloodshed, facing one another in the rubble, weapons drawn. Only under Nasus\u2019 stern, disappointed gaze did Renekton\u2019s bloodlust dwindle, and he turned away in shame.</p><p>War with the rebel state of Icathia changed many of the Ascended. The horrors they witnessed left them hollow, and quicker to anger. Nasus undertook centuries of solitary study as he tried to comprehend what had happened to his immortal brethren, and what it could mean for the future.</p><p>When the Ascension of Emperor Azir went terribly wrong, Nasus and Renekton were both far from the capital, and returned with all haste... but they were too late. Over the bodies of countless Shuriman dead, they fought Xerath\u2014that twisted, malevolent being of pure energy who had betrayed Azir\u2014yet were unable to slay him. Filled with rage, and perhaps seeking to atone for Nashramae, Renekton wrestled Xerath into the Tomb of the Emperors beneath the city, bidding Nasus seal them in.</p><p>Nasus refused, desperate to find any other way, but there was none. With a heavy heart, he committed Xerath and his brother to the fathomless darkness for all eternity.</p><p>Drained of its power by Xerath\u2019s sorcery, the Sun Disc fell, and every remaining god-warrior felt its loss in their immortal heart. The divine waters flowing from the city\u2019s oasis ran dry, bringing death and famine to all Shurima. For a time, the other Ascended tried to hold the fractured empire together, before their countless rivalries led them to fight among themselves. Withdrawing entirely, Nasus bore a heavy burden of guilt, stalking the empty ruins that were slowly being swallowed by the desert, and lamenting everything that had been lost.</p><p>Centuries passed, and Nasus all but forgot his former life and purpose... until the moment when the Tomb of the Emperors was rediscovered by mortals, and its seal broken. He did not know how, but he knew Xerath was free.</p><p>Ancient vigor reawakened in Nasus, and yet even he was stunned to see Azir reborn, and the Sun Disc raised once more from the sands. Though Xerath was still a grave threat, Nasus knew the new god-emperor would have great need of guidance and counsel in the years ahead.</p><p>And hope stirred within him for the first time in millennia. Did he dare believe he might also be reunited with his beloved brother, Renekton?</p>",

Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian of knowledge and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the empire to greatness for many centuries.

                "lore_full": "<p>To understand the legend of Nautilus, one must first know the man\u2014for even the tallest of tavern tales agree, he was indeed a man.</p><p>Though the waves have washed away the name he was born with, most remember Nautilus as no mere sailor, but as a salvage diver. Just beyond the southernmost reach of the Blue Flame Isles lies a graveyard of ships, rumored lost while searching for a blessed land, looking to trade wealth for immortality. On a fair day, their glittering holds beckon from beneath the surface. Many crews sought divers to collect the lost fortune, and none could match the skill of the quick-sinking hulk of solid muscle that was Nautilus.</p><p>With lungs that could steal the air from a galleon\u2019s sails, Nautilus preferred to freedive. Always bringing up plenty of gold or jewels for the crew, the man demanded no special wages\u2014he asked only that the captain toss a coin overboard as they set out, honoring and appeasing the vast ocean. A sailor\u2019s superstition to be sure, but many a sea-fearing crew made such offerings to ensure a safe return. </p><p>Years of salvage depleted the easy treasure, each haul becoming less and less, until one day Nautilus\u2019s crew learned that their ship and working papers had been bought out from under them.</p><p>The dawn was scarlet the morning the new captain came aboard. Hailing from a foreign port, he brought with him a giant suit of brass and iron. He zeroed in on Nautilus; indeed, he had purchased the command because of Nautilus. It was clear the captain was obsessed with a specific wreck, one shrouded in darkness even on a fair day. The diving armor could withstand the pressures of the ocean floor far longer than any man, long enough to collect what was hidden in the abnormal murk.</p><p>The crew agreed working was better than starving, and Nautilus found himself being bolted into the suit, the wooden deck groaning under the load. Panic rose in his throat when he realized that they had nothing to pay the tithe. The foreign captain laughed as Nautilus was lowered into the water. He assured the crew that whatever the Bearded Lady was protecting would make them all rich beyond their wildest dreams. When Nautilus returned to the surface, they would make their silly sacrifice.</p><p>As Nautilus sank, the light above dimmed, and all grew quiet, the man\u2019s own breath the only sound echoing in the iron suit. Then something reached out from the depths. He was being pulled down, and for the first time Nautilus felt liquid fear wrap itself around his heart. It was not treasure his captain sought, but some slumbering, eldritch power.</p><p>Nautilus grabbed the anchor chain, his last connection to the world above, and hauled himself up even as the thing below sought to drag him down. But the weight was too much. Just as his giant metal fingers were about to breach the surface, the chain snapped. Nautilus screamed within the suit, but none could hear him. He tumbled back into the inky maelstrom, clutching the sinking anchor in desperation. Dark tendrils enveloped him, and he could only watch as the dimming outline of his ship faded away. Then everything went black.</p><p>When Nautilus awoke on the ocean floor, he was something\u2026 different. The darkness could no longer hurt him. The great metal suit had become a seamless shell around him, concealing the bond that the primordial power had made with his spirit. Trapped in the sunless depths, he could remember only one thing\u2014the new captain\u2019s broken promise.</p><p>Nautilus vowed, there and then, that all would pay the ocean\u2019s tithe. He would see to it himself.</p><p>Driven ever forward by this thought, he trudged toward the shore. But by the time he reached Bilgewater, years had passed, and he could find no traces of his captain or crew. There was no life to which he could return, no revenge he could take. Instead he returned to the sea, allowing his anger to surface on the greedy, gutting their ships with his mighty anchor. </p><p>Sometimes, in the tumble of waves, distant memories of who he was push up above the waterline\u2026 but always the man who is Nautilus stays drowned just below the surface.</p>",

It is said he comes for those who forget to pay the \u201cBilgewater tithe\u201d, pulling them down beneath the waves with him\u2014an iron-clad reminder that none can escape the depths.",

They were called the Oovi-Kat, and could trace their lineage generation by generation back to the legendary Vastayashai\u2019rei\u2014the ancestors of all vastaya.</p><p>The Oovi-Kat were peaceful beings, of unrivaled potential. Their harmonious society blended seamlessly with the spirit realm, so that their <i>sho\u2019ma</i>\u2014their spiritual essence\u2014could intermingle with other beings through mere proximity, and even help them mimic other physical forms. No secrets existed between the Oovi-Kat, but few were as curious, resilient, or energetic as young Neeko.</p><p>She developed a fondness for games, hiding trinkets and thoughts to see if others could find them. Her inquisitive nature knew no bounds, and she was pure and innocent in her charmed existence.</p><p>But it was not to last. Cataclysm loomed on the horizon.</p><p>Thanks to the quick thinking and self-sacrifice of the Oovi-Kat elders, Neeko escaped the death of her homeland. She clumsily took the form of a bird, and fled the smoldering destruction, feeling the screams of her people fading into the ethereal gulf between realms.</p><p>Days later, desperate and exhausted, Neeko plummeted into the sea. She clung to driftwood, entirely at the mercy of the currents, until an odd silhouette rose into view. She could hear voices carrying over the waves, and so she swam toward the strange structure.</p><p>With the last of her strength, she crept aboard what turned out to be a mercantile vessel destined for Harelport. Neeko rested where she could, calling out into the spirit realm for her lost tribe. She felt only scattered, sad echoes in response, and images of towering, dead trees that lay somewhere over a fragile horizon\u2026</p><p>When Neeko emerged from the ship into the city, it was a strange and unfamiliar new world. All her senses tingled. Many a creature, even another Oovi-Kat, might be afraid in that situation\u2014but not Neeko. The society bustled with unique personalities, strangers with a vast array of motives and shapes. This was a place of countless stories and experiences, and it entranced her completely.</p><p>Before she could get far, she was spotted by a vastayan sailor named Krete. Neeko could not understand all his words, but he demanded to know which tribe she belonged to. Neeko reached out with her sho\u2019ma, mimicking his face and expression to make her peaceful intentions understood, but Krete did not seem to like this at all. Overwhelmed by his darkening thoughts, Neeko fled into the crowd, altering her shape many times until she escaped.</p><p>Surrounded by lush, tropical greenery in the hinterlands beyond Harelport, Neeko grappled with her recent experiences. She simply could not understand how anyone might rely solely on words as their singular form of communication. It seemed so\u2026 limiting?</p><p>Seeking solace, she took on the shape of the sleek jungle cats she encountered among the trees, and tried to run with them. Neeko loved being fast and agile, and their bright, keen eyes reminded her of home\u2014until, quite unexpectedly, the leader transformed into a beautiful, strong, dark-haired woman. After a tense standoff, she introduced herself as Nidalee, and reluctantly accepted Neeko into the group.</p><p>Neeko hesitated to entrust the truths of the Oovi-Kat to others, but she felt a deep kinship with Nidalee, because she suspected this bestial huntress might share some forgotten connection with the vastayan race. Their friendship blossomed, and for many months they roamed the wilds together.</p><p>But the towns and cities, with all their flaws, still called to Neeko. Her ancestors came to her in dreams, showing her the pale branches of those dead trees, over and over. The trees needed color, to bloom again\u2014of that much, Neeko was certain. She asked her friend to join her on this new journey, but Nidalee could not be persuaded.</p><p>Crestfallen, but determined, Neeko set out alone.</p><p>Her old life among the Oovi-Kat may be lost forever, but Neeko envisions a magical future\u2014a larger tribe of like-hearted vastaya, yordles, humans, and whatever other creatures might share her dream. As far as she is concerned, everyone has the potential to find a place in her new tribe. She has pledged to seek these souls out, to befriend them, and defend their sho\u2019ma with her life.</p><p>To know Neeko is to love Neeko, and to love Neeko is to <i>be</i> Neeko.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Far, far from the harsh deserts of the Great Sai, over savanna plains and mountain steppes, lie the great jungles on the border of Ixtal and Shurima. Swathed in mystery, they are home to wild, fantastical beasts, and dense forests blooming with life. But while there is overwhelming beauty to be found there, danger and death lurk nearby in equal measure.</p>\n<p>No one knows how Nidalee\u2014in the form of a cub\u2014came to be alone in the heart of the jungle, but it was her cries echoing through the trees that captured the attention of the jungle's fiercest cats: the pakaa.</p>\n<p>A mother, roaming with her cubs, approached Nidalee. Perhaps it was her scent, or a mother\u2019s intuition, that led the great cat to accept this strange kit without hesitation, half-leading, half-dragging her back to their den.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nidalee was raised in the company of the pakaa, who treated her as one of their own\u2014a creature of the jungle. She grew up playing alongside the other cubs, learning to hunt with tooth and claw and to stalk the jungles for her prey. She grew into her role as a member of the pack and as a capable huntress.</p>\n<p>Even so, at times Nidalee began to lose control of her own body. Without warning, her paws would change to strange hairless hands and feet, her sharp fangs to blunted teeth. Occasionally she would stumble from the den, delirious with fever, her body caught in a state of half-transformation as she followed the hazy silhouettes of two strange figures\u2014they whispered after her, their voices jumbled but sweet. They brought Nidalee a sense of comfort and warmth, even though her feline family had taught her to be wary of outsiders.</p>\n<p>And with good cause.</p>\n<p>It was at the height of the summer rains when she first encountered the Kiilash. These vastayan hunters ranged into the forests every season in search of prestigious kills and trophies to show their prowess. Nidalee's mother tried to chase them away, but fell, wounded by their blades and spears.</p>\n<p>But before the Kiilash could finish the aging wildcat, Nidalee lunged from the undergrowth, howling with grief and rage. As she tore into them with razor sharp claws and fangs, they rounded on her with even stronger weapons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But something had changed.</p>\n<p>She felt the spirit of another heritage, long forgotten, rise up within her. Transforming from pakaa to something resembling a human, she grabbed a hunter's lunging weapons with cat-like reflexes and nimble fingers and turned it upon her enemies. The Kiilash growled and hissed at this sight, and to her surprise Nidalee found she understood some of their speech.</p>\n<p>They cursed her, invoking the name of their Vastayashai'rei ancestors as they retreated from the fight, empty-handed.</p>\n<p>Hurling the spear aside, Nidalee held her dying mother close. Her siblings approached, wary of her new form but comforted by her familiar scent. With the passing of their mother they came to accept this shapechanger as their new leader\u2014from that day forth, she vowed to defend her adopted home against any who would seek to plunder it.</p>\n<p>Over time, she learned to better control her powers, eventually shifting between both forms with ease. She also became more adept with her new form, learning to take advantage of her surroundings while building traps and weapons unknown to the pakaa, crafting healing salves from honeyfruit, and utilizing seeds and flowers to protect and illuminate her territory. And in the back of her mind, she wondered whether she was the only one of the pakaa who could change their shape.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was a yearning to find others of her kind that led her to the chameleon-like wanderer Neeko, and the two became inseparable for a time. Nidalee delighted in mentoring her inquisitive new companion, and they reveled in exploring the jungle's numerous wonders together, before Neeko eventually departed to follow her own destiny beyond Shurima's shores.</p>\n<p>Even now, the dense forests remain the last truly untamed wilderness in the known world, and something of an enigma even to Nidalee. Still, in rare, quiet moments, the huntress finds herself dwelling on her own origins\u2014and her encounter with the Kiilash\u2014and whether she will learn the truth behind any of it\u2026</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>A confident and joyful woman who always wears an eerie smile, Nilah\u2019s sudden arrival in Bilgewater has sent the city into an uproar. Her duels with rampaging sea serpents defy the limits of human ability: Racing across the surface of the open ocean with a whip-blade formed from glittering, prismatic water, she scales the great beasts before dramatically slaying them, pausing only to thank her \u201cworthy enemies\u201d for their efforts. Any threat taller than a house is guaranteed to draw her into combat, and the deadlier and physically larger that threat is, the more determined she becomes to challenge and destroy it.</p>\n\n<p>Her strength and origins are shrouded in mystery. Yet the truth, known only to Nilah, is that she once had a different name and lived a very different life.</p>\n\n<p>The precocious child of a large Kathkani family, the girl who would become Nilah was not a warrior at all\u2014rather, she was a lanky bookworm with an interest in myths and legends. Kathkan had known relative peace since its neighbor Camavor\u2019s collapse almost a thousand years prior, and had no further need for great warriors or storied heroes. Or, at least, that\u2019s what Nilah believed.</p>\n\n<p>Wishing the age of heroes had never ended, she collected and obsessed over colorful tales of old\u2014epics of great beasts and shining warriors who clashed beneath the eyes of the gods, back when the world was young and humanity\u2019s enemies were a thousandfold. She read of the mad king Viego and his tragic fall, the genesis of the first dragons, and the foundation of the universe in the Kathkan tradition. Nilah memorized each in turn, knowing in her heart that their color and magic were more than simple fiction.</p>\n\n<p>One story, in particular, was her favorite: <em>The Cycle of Ashlesh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It spoke of the fantastical Lord of Joy, Ashlesh: A many-limbed beast who menaced the world along with its nine ferocious siblings. Hungering for primal joy, Ashlesh attempted to consume the realm of the gods\u2014but the gods struck the monster down, trapping it deep below the earth in an endless, shimmering lake within the seventh layer of the underworld. There it would be guarded by a mythical order of heroes.</p>\n\n<p>An order of heroes that, after unraveling the story\u2019s many riddles, Nilah realized was beneath her very feet in the heart of the Kathkani capital. Overcome with excitement, she struck out to find this hidden order\u2014to learn its secrets and perhaps even stand among the heroes as an equal...</p>\n\n<p>And then she was gone. All knowledge of the girl she was\u2014her face, her voice, her true name\u2014was erased from living memory. Records curled and evaporated, writing vanished from walls and texts, and words failed on the tongues of her friends and family. It was as though Nilah had never been born at all.</p>\n\n<p>The woman who resurfaced ten years later was a stranger to her homeland, unbound from the world she knew, yet possessed of a strange smile and an unending, ceaseless joy. Whatever happened to her during her long absence, she would not say. Perhaps she met the mythical order after all, and they trained her in the arts of magic and war. Perhaps she stood face to face with the primordial demon Ashlesh, battling it in the apocryphal darkness for a decade before finally emerging triumphant. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t the girl at all, but a pretender wearing her flesh... Or maybe the truth was somewhere in between. Whoever or whatever she was, she began calling herself \u201cNilah,\u201d the name of the legendary river of fate.</p>\n\n<p>And then her work began.</p>\n\n<p>Possessed of wiry, acrobatic strength, and wielding a liquid blade of incalculable might, she embarked on a conquest of the greatest threats of ancient myth: Grandmother Viper, the invincible progenitor of all Camavoran dragons; Imago, demon of change and scourge of the Carnelian Valley; the mad demigod Nabavelicus, perpetrator of countless atrocities.</p>\n\n<p>Each new foe rises against Nilah in challenge, and each is snuffed out in a ferocious battle of color and fury, dazzling all witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>Nilah's own legend grows with every victory. And with it, an epic tale has begun to take shape, following her journey through strange lands near and far. At her side is the power of Ashlesh itself, which Nilah wields against other evils that might one day threaten the safety of Kathkan. In her heart is the memory of what she has lost, and the knowledge of what is to come, driving her to face greater and greater opponents wherever they might be found.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever happened to that lanky girl who was buried in books, Nilah now faces her future with unbridled bliss. Her mere presence inspires others to fight alongside her, while her deeds ensure that people remember the hero she has become, even if they cannot remember the woman she once was.</p>\n\n<p>Facing the mythological villains of Runeterra with unerring glee, she will challenge the end itself if it means she can protect those who cannot protect themselves.</p>\n",

Channeling the demon\u2019s liquid form into a blade of unparalleled might, she stands defiant against ancient threats long forgotten.</p>",

For centuries, the practice of \u201cshadow magic\u201d was all but forbidden across Runeterra, for fear of reawakening the horrors it once unleashed upon the world.</p><p>The greatest of those horrors has a name, and its name is Nocturne.</p><p>Towards the end of the Rune Wars, desperate for victory, cabals of warrior-mages sought any advantage they could find over their foes. Although no record names the first of them to cast off their flesh and enter the spirit realm, it is known that they came to stalk one another not only on the battlefield, but in landscapes shaped by their own subconscious thoughts and emotions. Unconstrained by the laws of physical reality, they fought in ways that more mundane minds could scarcely comprehend, even conjuring subtle, etheric assassins to do their bidding. Shadow mages seemed particularly skilled at such things\u2014and so it was, for a time, that they came to dominate the spirit realm, casting it into twilight.</p><p>The thoughts of mortals everywhere were touched by this darkness. It sapped their morale and infected their dreams, with nameless fears hounding them day and night, driving some to commit ever more horrendous acts against their own kin.</p><p>No one can say for certain whether all this suffering created Nocturne from nothing, or if it merely corrupted a lesser assassin-construct into something more willful and deadly, but the shadowy creature that resulted was one of insubstantial form and fathomless dread. Nocturne understood nothing of kindness, honor, or nobility\u2014it was terror made manifest, with none of the restraint necessary to control itself.</p><p>This demonic creature howled within the spirit realm, and set upon those foolish, errant mages who had given it life, thrashing in desperation for an end to its own suffering. It was in pain, and that pain made it cruel, but it quickly acquired a taste for mortal fear. Time has little meaning in that other place, but Nocturne dragged out each and every pursuit for as long as possible, savoring the prey\u2019s anguish before cutting their life\u2019s silvery thread in an instant. Soon enough, there were none left who dared to enter Nocturne\u2019s domain.</p><p>Would the outcome of the Rune Wars have been different if the demon had not played its part beyond the veil? It is difficult to say for certain, but afterwards, what little remained of the lore of shadow magic was hidden away, and its practice carried the sentence of death in many lands.</p><p>Trapped in the spirit realm, and with precious few intruders to sustain it, Nocturne began to starve. The only thing close to the delectable feasts of fear it had once tasted was when mortal minds unknowingly drifted through the ether in the hours of sleep. Drawn on currents of magic to where the two realms divide\u2014and where peaceful dreams can easily become night terrors\u2014Nocturne found a way to manifest itself into the waking world.</p><p>Existing now as a shade, eyes burning with cold light, Nocturne has become a sinister reflection of the most primal fears of the many peoples of Runeterra. From the bustling cities to the desolate plains, from the mightiest king to the lowliest peasant, the demon is drawn to any weakness of spirit it can twist into mortal terror, and everlasting darkness.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>A demonic amalgamation drawn from the nightmares that haunt every sentient mind, the thing known as Nocturne has become a primordial force of pure terror. It is liquidly chaotic in aspect, a faceless shadow with cold eyes and armed with wicked-looking blades. After freeing itself from the spirit realm, Nocturne now continually descends upon the waking world, to feed on the kind of fear that can only thrive in true darkness.<p>",

Together, they gathered tales that Layka turned into songs. For Nunu, nothing was better than journeying from village to village, hearing his mother sing of ancient heroes. With music and dance, the Notai brought one last celebration to everyone they met, as each winter\u2019s chill set in.</p>\n<p>Riding the wave of frost spilling from Anivia\u2019s wings, his heart beating the rhythm of a jubilant song, Nunu\u2019s world was full of possibility.</p>\n<p>On his fifth nameday, Layka gave Nunu a special gift: a flute, so he could learn to play her melodies himself. In the safety of their cart, the two bundled together and followed the knotted string that served as Layka\u2019s heart-song, recording everywhere they\u2019d been together, as the years came and went.</p>\n<p>When the caravan was attacked by raiders, Nunu was separated from his mother. Though he was dragged to safety by the surviving Notai, he was left to wonder what had happened to Layka, waiting to hear her songs on the wind\u2026</p>\n<p>Snow fell. Weeks passed.</p>\n<p>Nunu missed his mother desperately, but the Notai assured him no child could safely search for her. They weren\u2019t even impressed when he showed them the flute he now called <em>Svellsongur</em>\u2014the name of a mighty blade existing only in his imagination.</p>\n<p>Nunu spent more and more time alone, escaping into his mother\u2019s songs\u2014the legends and heroes of old. He yearned to be one of these heroes, perhaps even a great warrior like the Frostguard, who could have saved his mother. He even met their leader, Lissandra, who asked countless questions about his mother\u2019s stories, always seeking information about one <em>particular</em> song.</p>\n<p>No one believed he could be a hero, not even the other Notai children, who teased him for his flute when they now had daggers. But Nunu knew the songs in his heart, and one night, he realized how he could prove himself <em>and</em> persuade the others to help to find his mother.</p>\n<p>From the tribe\u2019s fearful whispers, he\u2019d learned of a fierce monster that killed all who sought its power, thwarting the local hunters who were sent each year, never to return. There was a song that Nunu\u2019s mother sang\u2026 one that he now couldn\u2019t seem to stop singing to himself.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Nunu understood what he had to do. He could name the beast. It would answer his challenge, and feel the wrath of <em>Svellsongur</em>!</p>\n<p>Using his flute to tame a herd of elkyr, Nunu snuck out into the snow. One lonely child traveled to face a monster, finally living out a legend that not even he could imagine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><hr class=\"story-divider\">\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An ancient and noble race that once ruled over the mountains of the Freljord, the yeti civilization was destroyed in a cataclysm of ice. Forced to watch his brethren descending into savagery after being stripped of their magic, one yeti swore to protect what remained of their power\u2014a gem that swirled with the frozen dreams of any mortal mind nearby.</p>\n<p>As the last magical yeti, the guardian was also shaped by perception. Though he had been chosen to safeguard the magic until it would be needed again, he could find no worthy vessel. The men who intruded upon his ruined home had only malice in their hearts\u2026 and so a monster greeted them with fang and claw.</p>\n<p>But the guardian knew he was forgetting something. His name\u2026 and the names of those he had loved...</p>\n<p>Once, there had been song.</p>\n<p>That all changed when a young boy stumbled into the ruins. After centuries of unbroken vigil, the monster was prepared to end the boy\u2019s life, snarling as he sensed the human approach.</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, the gem brought forth images of heroes slaying dragons and beheading ancient serpents from the boy\u2019s mind. The child roared, drawing his flute like a fearsome sword. But the blow never came, for even as the boy saw visions of heroes swirling around him, he realized the deeper truths of the songs his mother sang\u2026</p>\n<p>When he looked at the guardian, he didn\u2019t see a monster. He saw someone who needed a friend.</p>\n<p>Still enraged, the yeti did not expect the first snowball to the face. Or the second. <em>Snowball fight</em>! In anger, then shock, then joy, the guardian joined in, shaped not by fear, but by a child\u2019s imagination. He was growing furrier and friendlier. His growl was becoming a laugh.</p>\n<p>Until the beast accidentally broke the boy\u2019s flute.</p>\n<p>As the child began to cry, the guardian felt a kindred grief take shape around the gem. For centuries, he had looked into it and seen the end of his people\u2014<em>the threat they had buried, betrayal by the blind one</em>\u2014and now, instead, he saw a caravan burning. He heard a voice on the wind. He sensed something else within the boy, something he had never felt from a human, not even the three sisters who had come to him long ago. It was love, fighting back despair.</p>\n<p>In that moment, the guardian knew the Freljord\u2019s only hope lay in the power <em>already</em> within this child. The magic he\u2019d been guarding was a tool; what truly mattered was the heart that would shape it. With a gesture, the magic passed from the gem into the boy, giving him the ability to make his imagination real. To repair his flute, freezing it in dreams that hardened into True Ice. </p>\n<p>To imagine a best friend named \u201cWillump.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><hr class=\"story-divider\">\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Escaping into the Freljordian plains, Nunu\u2019s heart and Willump\u2019s strength now enable the pair to do what they never could alone: to have an adventure! Following the songs of Nunu\u2019s mother, they snowball wildly from one place to the next, holding onto the hope that she is still out there, somewhere.</p>\n<p>But Willump knows that with magic and dreams come responsibility. One day the games will end, as the dark ice at the heart of the Freljord thaws, and thaws\u2026</p>",

Spurred on by his hunger for glory and the looming curse of a forgettable death, Olaf throws himself into every fight with reckless abandon. Surrendering to the bloodlust deep within his being, Olaf is only truly alive when grappling with the jaws of death.<br><br>The coastal peninsula of Lokfar is among the most brutal places in the Freljord. There, rage is the only fire to warm frozen bones, blood is the only liquid that flows freely, and there is no worse fate than to grow old, frail, and forgotten. Olaf was a warrior of Lokfar with no shortage of glories and no hesitation to share them. While boasting one evening with his clansmen over the burning embers of a razed village, one of the elder warriors grew tired of Olaf's bluster. The old fighter goaded Olaf to read the omens and see if Olaf's fortunes matched his gloating. Emboldened by the challenge, Olaf mocked the aged raider's envy and tossed the knuckle bones of a long-dead beast to predict the heights of glory he'd achieve in death. All mirth left the gathering as the clansmen read the portents: the bones spoke of a long life and a quiet passing.<br><br>Infuriated, Olaf stormed into the night determined to prove the prediction false by finding and slaughtering Lokfar's feared frost serpent. The monster had consumed thousands, man and ship alike, in its long lifetime and to die in battle with it would be a fitting end for any warrior. As Olaf hurled himself into the blackness of its maw, he fell deeper into the blackness of his mind. When the shock of freezing water roused him from the dark, there was only the butchered carcass of the beast afloat beside him. Thwarted but not defeated, Olaf set out to hunt down every legendary creature with claws and fangs, hoping that the next battle would be his last. Each time he charged headlong toward his coveted death, only to be spared by the frenzy that washed over him while on its brink.<br><br>Olaf concluded that no mere beast could grant him a warrior's death. His solution was to take on the most fearsome tribe in the Freljord: the Winter's Claw. Sejuani appeared amused by Olaf's challenge to her warband, but his audacity would earn him no mercy. She ordered the charge and sent scores of her warriors to overwhelm Olaf. One by one, they fell until he lost himself in the bloodlust once again, effortlessly cutting a path to the leader of the Winter's Claw. The clash between Olaf and Sejuani rocked the glaciers with its force, and though he seemed unstoppable, Sejuani battled the berserker to a standstill. As they stood deadlocked, Sejuani's glare penetrated Olaf's berserker haze in a way no weapon ever could. His frenzy abated long enough for her to make him an offer: Sejuani swore that she would find Olaf his glorious death if he would lend his axe to her campaign of conquest. In that moment, Olaf vowed he would carve his legacy into the Freljord itself.<br><br>",

Hailing from the brutal Freljordian peninsula of Lokfar, he once received a prophecy foretelling his peaceful passing\u2014a coward's fate, and a great insult among his people. Seeking death, and fueled by rage, he rampaged across the land, slaughtering scores of great warriors and legendary beasts in search of any opponent who could stop him.

                "lore_full": "<p>Nestled among the eclectic storefronts of Piltover sat the workshop of the renowned artificer Corin Reveck. Famous for his masterful craft in artificial limbs, Corin\u2019s intricate brass designs made the prosthetics both breathtakingly beautiful and often superior to the originals. His daughter, Orianna, served as his apprentice\u2014friendly and inquisitive, she was a natural fit to run the shop, and blossomed into a capable artisan in her own right.</p><p>Orianna had an adventurous spirit, but her father, fearing for her safety, never allowed her to venture beyond their neighborhood. Instead, he took her to the theater, where dancers, through leaps and pirouettes, told stories of distant lands. Orianna dreamed of visiting these strange and marvelous places, and would scurry home to build clockwork dancers of her own.</p><p>News of disaster in the undercity of Zaun made its way to their shop. An explosion had ruptured a chemical line, venting clouds of poisonous gas. Orianna insisted they help the victims, but Corin forbade it. Zaun was far too dangerous.</p><p>So, with as many supplies as she could carry, Orianna snuck away in the night and rode the hexdraulic descender into the depths.</p><p>The devastation was overwhelming. Debris still filled the streets, and Zaunites walked through the toxic haze, faces covered with little more than oily rags. Night after night, Orianna repaired respirators and installed esophilters. She even gave her own mask to a child who could scarcely breathe.</p><p>Her father was furious, but soon after her return, Orianna fell gravely ill. Her lungs were ravaged past all hope of recovery. Refusing to accept this, Corin threw himself into his most ambitious project yet: a fully functional set of artificial lungs.</p><p>After weeks of sleepless nights, he completed his desperate task and carried out the surgery himself. To keep her from ever venturing too far again, the lungs were wound with a special key Corin kept in his safe.</p><p>Orianna returned to work, and yet the poison continued to spread throughout her body. Father and daughter worked feverishly to develop new implants and prosthetics, replacing each of her organs as they failed. Piece by piece, Orianna's body was transformed from mortal to mechanical until only her healthy heart remained. This long\u2014and expensive\u2014process cost Corin his fortune, forcing him to relocate their business to Zaun\u2026 but he saved his daughter's life. And, for a time, they were happy.</p><p>Gradually, Orianna began to feel disconnected from who she had been before. Old memories felt like stories. Even her creativity began to fade, and her beloved clockwork dancers became more like masterfully tuned mechanisms than works of art.</p><p>But, even as time seemed to stand still for Orianna, it marched onward for her father.</p><p>Long, lean years brought Corin agonizing chest spasms that meant he could no longer work, and Orianna was forced to provide for him. She'd become profoundly adept at crafting her figurines, even if she took only distant pleasure in recalling what once inspired their creation. The miniature dancers brought in good coin and barter, but never enough to afford the one thing she believed could save her father. For that, she turned to a local chem-baron.</p><p>Orianna never asked <i>how</i> the man came by a hextech crystal. She simply paid what he asked. Even so, before she could use it, the chem-baron returned demanding a second payment. Then a third. When the money ran out, Orianna knew his next visit would end in violence. She looked to the crystal device, still incomplete, too unrefined and powerful for a human body. She saw the logical solution\u2014she didn't need her human heart anymore, and Corin needed a heart no one could ever take from him.</p><p>She spent weeks in preparation, building a clockwork orb\u2014integrating it into her own mechanisms, readying it to house the crystal so she could defend herself in the journey ahead. Slipping her father a sleeping draught, she commenced the surgery.</p><p>Corin became one with the last remnant of the daughter he had known and loved. She listened to his steady heartbeat through the night, the quiet hum of hextech in the beautifully intricate ball by her side. Only then did she realize she had shed the last of her humanity\u2014but she felt no fear or remorse, merely acceptance. She had become something entirely new, a lady of clockwork, and she needed to find where in the world's vast machine she might fit.</p><p>At dawn, she collected the key that wound her lungs, a single pulse from her ball welding it firmly to her back. Then she left for good.</p>Corin woke to find his workshop filled with hundreds of figurines. But among them was one he vowed never to sell: pirouetting to an endless ballet, a golden dancer that needed no key.</p>",

It was widely held that he was the firstborn of the old demi-gods, who had shaped the land itself, and brought forth the first snows.</p><p>More than any other of his kind, Ornn was said to value privacy, solitude, and focus. Beneath a dormant volcano that bore scars from some ancient eruption, he labored day and night, forging whatever his heart desired. The results were priceless tools destined for feats of legend\u2014the lucky few who have stumbled upon these relics note their bewilderingly high quality. Some even claim that Braum\u2019s shield was made by Ornn thousands of years ago, and remains as sturdy as the day it was finished.</p><p>No one can be sure, however, for none can find the forge-god to ask him. Almost all the tales of Ornn\u2019s deeds and accomplishments have been excised from history by his enemies, and the slow march of time.</p><p>The few that remain are remembered by the handful of tribes who can trace their lineage back to a single culture of blacksmiths, architects, and brewmasters. This long-lost populace was known as the Hearthblood, apprentices who journeyed from all corners of Valoran, and gathered on the slopes of Hearth-Home to follow Ornn\u2019s example.</p><p>Despite this imitative form of worship, Ornn never considered himself their patron. He would only give them curt nods or frowns when they offered up their work, and yet the Hearthblood accepted this and were determined to hone their skills. As a result, they came to create the finest tools, design the sturdiest structures, and brew the tastiest ales the world had ever beheld. They believed Ornn secretly approved of their perseverance, and the fact that they were always looking to better themselves in their craft.</p><p>But, in one catastrophic night, all the Hearthblood had accomplished was destroyed when Ornn battled with his brother Volibear at the mountain\u2019s peak, for reasons no mortal could comprehend. The resultant cataclysm was a storm of fire and ash and lightning so intensely violent that it was seen ten horizons away.</p><p>When the dust settled, Hearth-Home was a smoldering caldera, and the Hearthblood were reduced to scattered bones and cinders.</p><p>Though he would never admit it, Ornn was devastated. Through the Hearthblood he had glimpsed the sweeping potential of mortal life, only to see it all lost beneath the indiscriminate wrath of his immortal struggle. Wracked with guilt, he retreated to the isolation of his foundry, and buried himself in his work for an age.</p><p>Now, perhaps he senses that the world is on the cusp of a new era. Some of his siblings appear to have taken physical form once more, their cults of followers growing restless and aggressive. The Freljord itself is fractured and leaderless, and ancient horrors are lurking in the shadows, waiting for any opportunity to strike\u2026</p><p>In the wars to come, and in their aftermath, Ornn knows that the Freljord\u2014and the rest of Runeterra\u2014will have need of a good blacksmith.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Ornn is the Freljordian demi-god of forging and craftsmanship. He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home. There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other deities\u2014especially Volibear\u2014walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Atreus was born on the hostile slopes of Targon, and named after a star in the constellation of War, known as the Pantheon.</p><p>From an early age, he knew he was destined for battle. Like many in his tribe, he trained to join the Rakkor\u2019s militant order, the Ra\u2019Horak. Never the strongest or the most skilled warrior, Atreus somehow persevered, standing up, bloodied and bruised, after each bout. In time, he developed a fierce rivalry with a fellow recruit, Pylas\u2014but no matter how often Atreus was cast onto the stones, he stood back up. Pylas was impressed by his unrelenting endurance, and through the blood they spilled in the training circle, a true brotherhood was born.</p><p>Atreus and Pylas were among the Rakkor who stumbled across a barbarian incursion, surviving the ambush that left the rest of their patrol dead. When the Aspect of the Sun refused to destroy these trespassers, Atreus and Pylas swore to capture the power of the Aspects themselves by climbing to the peak of Mount Targon.</p><p>Like so many before them, they underestimated how arduous the ascent would be, with Pylas shivering his last upon finally reaching the summit. Only Atreus remained as the skies opened, making him host to a divine Aspect, with the power to take revenge.</p><p>But it was not a man who returned to the Rakkor afterward, spear and shield gleaming with celestial might. It was the Aspect of War itself, the <i>Pantheon</i>. Judging Atreus unworthy, a warrior who had known only defeat, it had taken control of his body to pursue its own ends\u2014a task it considered too great for mortal men.</p><p>Cast into the furthest corners of his own mind, Atreus endured only vague visions as the Aspect scoured the world for Darkin, living weapons created in a bygone age.</p><p>Eventually, Pantheon was goaded into battle not far from Mount Targon by the Darkin Aatrox, who sought the mountain\u2019s peak. Their fight raged into the skies, and swept through the armies of men beneath\u2026 until the impossible occurred. The Darkin\u2019s god-killing blade was driven into Pantheon\u2019s chest, a blow that carved the constellation of War from the heavens.</p><p>But as the Aspect faded, Atreus\u2014the man it had considered weak\u2014awoke once more. Impaled upon Aatrox\u2019s blade, and with the power of the Aspect\u2019s weapons dimming, he took a ragged breath, and spit in the Darkin\u2019s face. Aatrox sneered, and left Atreus to die.</p><p>Hours later, as the crows descended, Atreus painfully stood back up, stumbling back to the Rakkor in a trail of blood. After a lifetime of defeat, his will to live, and his anger at betrayal, were enough to stave off the death that had claimed War itself.</p><p>Atreus recovered on Pylas\u2019 homestead, nursed back to health by his friend\u2019s widow, Iula. There, Atreus realized he\u2019d spent his life looking to the stars, never considering what lay beneath. Unlike gods, mortals fought because they <i>must</i>, knowing that death lay in wait. It was a resilience he saw in all life, the threats unending.</p><p>Indeed, barbarian invaders now threatened the Rakkor\u2019s northern settlements, including Iula\u2019s farm. Though it was months before he could lift a spear, Atreus was determined to end this scourge himself, and eventually set out with the Aspect\u2019s dulled weapons in hand.</p><p>Yet, when he arrived, he found his sworn enemies already under siege. He knew from their cries, from the overwhelming stench of blood\u2026 they faced Aatrox.</p><p>It was Aatrox who had driven the barbarians into Targon, Atreus realized. Though he\u2019d considered them his foes, they were much like the Rakkor\u2014mortals who suffered in the conflicts between greater powers. Atreus felt a cold rage at both the Darkin and the Aspects. They were no different. They were the problem.</p><p>Atreus put himself between the barbarians and Aatrox. Recognizing the battered shield and spear of the fallen Aspect, the Darkin mocked him\u2014what hope had Atreus now, without the Pantheon\u2019s power? But even though Aatrox\u2019s blows cast him to his knees, Atreus\u2019 own will reignited the Aspect\u2019s spear, upon hearing the cries of the people around him\u2026 and with a mighty leap, he struck a blow that severed the Darkin\u2019s sword arm.</p><p>Both blade and Darkin fell to the ground. Only Atreus still stood, and watched his namesake star blaze back to life in the heavens.</p><p>Though he often yearns to return to Iula\u2019s farm, Atreus vowed that day to stand against Aspects, Ascended, demons, and any who wield power so great, it can only destroy. Forsaking his own name, he has become a <i>new</i> Pantheon\u2014the Aspect\u2019s weapons fueled by the will to fight that can only exist in the face of death.</p><p>For with the divine Pantheon gone, War must be reborn in man.</p>",

In time, he learned to embrace the power of his own mortality, and the stubborn resilience that goes along with it.

Bearing a hammer twice the length of her body, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching for the \u201cHero of Demacia,\u201d a fabled warrior said to be the rightful wielder of her weapon.</p>\n<p>As legend describes it, this hero is the only person who can unlock the full power of the hammer and lead Demacia to true greatness. Though Poppy has searched the furthest corners of the kingdom for this legendary fighter, her quest has proven fruitless. Each time she has attempted to pass the hammer on to a potential hero, the results have been disastrous, often ending in the warrior\u2019s death. Most people would have abandoned the task long ago, but most people do not possess the pluck and resolve of this indomitable heroine.</p>\n<p>Poppy was once a very different yordle. For as long as she could remember, she had been in search of a purpose. Feeling alienated by the chaotic whimsy of other yordles, she preferred to soak up stability and structure where she could find it. This drive brought her to the human settlements of western Valoran, where she gazed in wonder at the caravans striping the countryside in an endless file. Many of the people there looked tattered and weary, but they stumbled on in pursuit of some ephemeral better life that might lie just beyond the horizon.</p>\n<p>One day, however, a different sort of caravan passed through. Unlike the other travelers, these people seemed to move with purpose. They all awoke at the exact same time each morning, roused by the sound of a watchman\u2019s horn. They took their meals together every day at the same hour, always finishing within a few minutes. They set up their camps and took them down with remarkable efficiency.</p>\n<p>While yordles used their innate magic to fashion extraordinary things, these humans achieved equally astounding feats through coordination and discipline. They acted in concert like the cogs of a gear, becoming something much larger and stronger than any single person could ever be. To Poppy, that was more marvelous than all the magic in the world.</p>\n<p>As Poppy watched the camp from the safety of her hiding place, her eyes caught the gleam of armor emerging from a tent. It was the group\u2019s commanding officer, wearing a brigandine of gleaming steel plates, each piece overlapping, each an integral part of the whole. The man\u2019s name was Orlon, and his presence seemed to stir the souls of everyone there. If someone became discouraged, he was there to remind them of why they pressed on. If someone collapsed from exhaustion, he inspired them to get up. It reminded Poppy of certain yordle charms, though again, <em>without magic</em>.</p>\n<p>Poppy crept in for a closer look. She found herself following this shining commander, as if drawn to him by fate itself. She observed Orlon as he led his soldiers in training exercises. He was not a large fellow, yet he swung his massive battle hammer with surprising alacrity. At night, Poppy listened intently to his hushed discussions with the elders of the camp. She heard them making plans to pull up stakes and head west to build a permanent settlement.</p>\n<p>Poppy\u2019s mind was overwhelmed with questions. Where was Orlon going? Where did he come from? How did he assemble this meticulous band of travelers, and was there a place for a yordle in it? At that moment, she made the most important decision in her life: For the first time ever, she would reveal herself to a human, as this was the first time she\u2019d ever felt a connection with one.</p>\n<p>The introduction was a jarring one, with Orlon having just as many questions for Poppy as she had for him, but the two soon became inseparable. He became a mentor to her, and she a devotee to his cause. In the training grounds, Poppy was an invaluable sparring partner\u2013the only member of Orlon\u2019s battalion who was unafraid to strike him. She was never obsequious, questioning his decisions with an almost childlike innocence, as though she didn\u2019t know she was supposed to meekly follow orders. She accompanied him to the site of the new settlement\u2013an ambitious new nation called Demacia, where all were welcome, regardless of station or background, so long as they contributed to the good of the whole.</p>\n<p>Orlon became a beloved figure throughout the kingdom. Though few had actually seen him wield his hammer, he always bore it on his back, and the weapon quickly became a revered icon for the fledgling nation. People whispered that it had the power to level mountains and tear the earth itself asunder.</p>\n<p>Orlon passed the hammer to Poppy on his deathbed, and with it, his hope of an enduring kingdom. It was only then that Orlon told her the story of his weapon\u2019s creation, and how it was never truly intended for his hands. He explained to Poppy that the hammer was meant to go to the Hero of Demacia\u2013the only one who could keep Demacia whole. As her friend drew his last breath, Poppy swore to him that she would find this hero and place the weapon in his hands.</p>\n<p>But what Poppy possesses in resolve, she lacks in ego, as it never even occurred to her that <em>she</em> might be the hero Orlon described.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>As a youth, Pyke started out like many in Bilgewater: on the slaughter docks. All day, every day, monstrous creatures of the deep were hauled in for rendering in the butcheries that lined the waterfront. He found employment in a district known as Bloodharbor, as even the tide itself was not strong enough to wash away the red slick that ran constantly down its wooden slips.</p><p>He became well acquainted with the trade\u2014both the gruesome work and meager paychecks. Over and over, Pyke watched heavy purses of gold being handed to captains and crews in exchange for the daunting carcasses that he and his fellows would hack into salable chunks. He became hungry for more than a few copper sprats in his pocket, and managed to talk his way onto a ship\u2019s crew. Few individuals dared to hunt in the traditional Serpent Isles manner: launching themselves at their targets to secure tow-hooks with their bare hands, and beginning to butcher the creatures while they yet lived. Fearless and highly skilled in this regard, Pyke soon cut a name for himself as the best harpooner a golden kraken could buy. He knew meat was worth pennies compared to certain organs from the larger, more dangerous beasts\u2026 organs that needed to be harvested fresh.<br /> <br />Depending on the difficulty of the hunt, each sea monster commanded its own price, and the most desired by Bilgewater traders was the jaull-fish. From its razor-toothed maw, priceless sacs of sapphilite were coveted across Runeterra for various sorcerous distillations, and a small flask of the glowing blue oil could pay for a ship and its crew ten times over. But it was while hunting with an untested captain that Pyke learned where a life of blood and guts would land him.</p><p>Days into their journey, a huge jaull-fish breached, opening its maw wide to reveal rows of sapphilite sacs. Several harpoon lines secured the beast, and though it was far bigger and older than any he had encountered before, Pyke leapt into its mouth without hesitation.</p><p>As he set about his work, a deep vibration began to stir in the creature\u2019s cavernous gullet. Roiling bubbles broke the ocean\u2019s surface, and an entire pod of jaulls began to push against the tethered ship\u2019s hull. The captain lost his nerve, and cut Pyke\u2019s lifeline. The last thing the doomed harpooner saw before the beast\u2019s jaws snapped shut was the look of horror on his crewmates\u2019 faces, as they watched him being swallowed alive.<br /> <br />But this was not the end for Pyke.</p><p>In the deepest fathoms of the unknowable ocean, crushed by the titanic pressure, and still firmly trapped within the jaull\u2019s mouth, he opened his eyes once more. There were blue lights everywhere, thousands of them, seemingly watching him. Tremulous echoes of something ancient and mysterious filled his brain, crushing his mind, showing him visions of all he had lost whilst others grew fat.</p><p>A new hunger overtook Pyke, one for vengeance and retribution. He would fill the depths with the corpses of those who had wronged him.<br /> <br />Back in Bilgewater, no one thought much of the killings at first\u2014for so dangerous a place, the occasional red tide was nothing new. But weeks became months, and a pattern began to emerge. Captains from many ships were found carved up and left out for the dawn. Bar-room patrons whispered it was a supernatural killer, wronged at sea, gutting his way through the crew manifest of some damned ship called the <i>Terror</i>. Once a mark of respect and celebrity, the question \u201cYou a captain?\u201d became a cause for alarm.</p><p>Soon it was the caulkers, too, and the first mates, merchant officers, bankers\u2026 indeed, anyone associated with the bloody business of the slaughter docks. A new name went up on the bounty boards: a thousand krakens for the infamous Bloodharbor Ripper.<br /> <br />Driven by memories twisted by the deep, Pyke has succeeded where many have failed\u2014striking fear into the hearts of unscrupulous businessmen, killers, and seafaring scoundrels alike, even though no one can find any mention of a ship named the <i>Terror</i> ever docking in Bilgewater.</p><p>A city that prides itself on hunting monsters now finds a monster hunting them, and Pyke has no intention of stopping.</p>",

Now, stalking the dank alleys and backways of his former hometown, he uses his new supernatural gifts to bring a swift and gruesome end to those who make their fortune by exploiting others\u2014and a city that prides itself on hunting monsters now finds a monster hunting them.",

                "lore_full": "<p>The youngest child in a ruling family, Qiyana grew up believing she would never inherit the high seat of the Yun Tal. As her parents governed Ixaocan, a city-state hidden deep in the jungles of Ixtal, they raised their children to succeed them, schooling them in the proud traditions of their isolated nation. Primed to rule before her, Qiyana\u2019s nine older sisters received most of the attention, and she often longed to find her own meaningful place in the family.</p><p>That place became clear the day young Qiyana began to learn the ancient elemental magic of Ixtal. Soon after she took up lessons, she realized she was blessed with extraordinary talent. Though Qiyana was only seven years old, she mastered advanced techniques within weeks, while some of her older sisters had yet to grasp the basics after years of study.</p><p>One by one, Qiyana surpassed her sisters in the elemental arts, and the more she progressed, the more resentful she became. Why did her parents waste so much effort grooming her inferior siblings? Each time they were chosen to preside over the grand rituals that shrouded Ixtal from the outside world, Qiyana lashed out in frustration, picking fights to prove her worth. It wasn\u2019t long before Inessa, the eldest sister and immediate successor, became the target for Qiyana\u2019s aggression.</p><p>Rather than defusing the conflict, Inessa bristled at the disrespect from her sister, who was twelve years her junior. As both grew older, their words became increasingly heated, culminating in physical threats from Inessa, and a challenge from Qiyana: they should decide who was strongest in ritual combat, for all of Ixaocan to see\u2014and for the right to succeed their parents. Inessa accepted the challenge to teach her sister some much needed humility.</p><p>When the contest was over, Inessa was never to walk again, while Qiyana stood unscathed.</p><p>She was eager to take her place as the rightful heir, but Qiyana\u2019s parents were furious at her actions. They denied her the prize\u2014tradition decreed that Qiyana would always be tenth in line to inherit the high seat of the Yun Tal. Though the news was bitter, Qiyana soon discovered that the duel had made her elemental prowess known across all of Ixaocan. At last, she had found what had long eluded her: respect.</p><p>That respect quickly became an addiction. Qiyana felt a burning need to be recognized for her exceptional skill. In fact, all of Ixaocan should stand proud with her, and put the world in its place with their powerful elemental magic. Instead, they were hiding from foreign explorers, and miners who were uprooting the jungle on their borders. </p><p>In her parents\u2019 court, Qiyana laid out her ambitions\u2014to drive off the miners and restore the lands. Qiyana\u2019s parents rejected the idea. Contact with the \u201coutlanders\u201d would bring hatred, war, and disease, jeopardizing what their dynasty had protected for centuries. Qiyana stewed, impatient to prove her strength to the world, and determined to prove her parents wrong.</p><p>Acting against their will, Qiyana raided the mining site, killing all the miners but one. As the man\u2019s eyes shone brightly with fear, Qiyana knew he would spread her message\u2014he would tell everyone in his Pilt-over about the grand elementalist who destroyed their mine.</p><p>In Ixaocan, Qiyana gladly took credit for the slaughter, infuriating her mother and father. They told her the Piltovan merchants were sending fresh miners and armsmen into the jungle. Qiyana\u2019s parents would not risk their insubordinate daughter drawing even more outlanders toward their borders, and regretfully ordered her imprisoned for her crime.</p><p>Just as she was detained, several elementalists of the court came to Qiyana\u2019s defense. The elemental talent displayed in the jungle was unheard of, and they convinced her parents that Qiyana should aid them in powering and defending the city. Qiyana was released, once she swore renewed fealty to her elders, and vowed to never cross paths with an outlander again.</p><p>As a growing number of admirers throw their support behind Qiyana, she has finally realized her true place in the world. She holds a power stronger than tradition, and she will climb the ladder of succession by any means necessary.</p><p>She is the greatest elementalist the world has ever seen. She is the inevitable ruler of Ixaocan, and the future empress of all Ixtal.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Quinn and her twin brother, Caleb, were born in Uwendale, a remote mountain hamlet in northeastern Demacia. It was a thriving village of hunters and farmers, protected by rangers who patrolled the wilderness and drove off any dangerous creatures wandering down from the high peaks.</p><p>When the twins were still young, King Jarvan III visited Uwendale on a tour of his kingdom. Quinn and Caleb thrilled at the pageantry of the knights in his entourage, resplendent in their gleaming armor. Their father, a weaponsmith in the village, later saw them pretending to bravely defend the land themselves, and fashioned simple weapons for them to play with.</p><p>But as they grew, they spent every moment they could outdoors with their mother\u2014a warden among the local rangers. She taught them how to survive in the wilds, how to track beasts, and most importantly how to fight. Quinn and Caleb became a formidable team\u2014with her keen eye for trails, his skill at baiting their prey, her aim with a bow, and his prowess with a hunting spear.</p><p>But one expedition ended in tragedy.</p><p>Quinn and Caleb, now rangers for Uwendale, were hired to accompany a party of nobles from the capital as they hunted a giant tuskvore\u2014a predator known for its thick hide, long horns, and ferocious temperament. But they failed to kill the creature outright, and the wounded beast turned on them. The twins were quick to intervene, with Caleb\u2019s spear putting out one of the monster\u2019s eyes, and Quinn driving off the tuskvore with her arrows... but not before it gored Caleb with its deadly horns.</p><p>The leader of the party, Lord Barrett Buvelle, helped Quinn bury her brother near where he had fallen. But all could see his death had broken her.</p><p>Unable to move on, she would return to the gravesite, and the joy she had felt as a ranger began to dim. Her prowess in the wilderness waned, and she started making mistakes\u2014she missed easy tracks, and her aim was off.</p><p>A few months later, Lady Lestara Buvelle visited Quinn\u2019s family. The noblewoman was grateful that Quinn had saved her husband\u2019s life, and asked what she could do to repay them. Quinn could think of nothing. She thanked Lady Buvelle, and politely turned her away.</p><p>A year to the day after Caleb\u2019s death, Quinn returned to his grave, as she so often did. Lost in grief, she didn\u2019t hear the approaching tuskvore, its one eye marking it as the very beast that had slain her brother.</p><p>The monster charged. Quinn fired arrow after arrow, but to no avail, and she knew it was her doom. Just then, a majestic bird swooped in\u2014an azurite eagle, a breed long thought extinct. The eagle\u2019s talons and beak ripped bloody gouges across the tuskvore\u2019s face, but the creature was resilient, its horns tearing into the bird\u2019s wing.</p><p>Quinn fired her last arrow as the monster charged her again. This time her aim was true, and the shaft flew right down its gullet, felling the creature in a heartbeat.</p><p>Though the eagle was injured, she approached with caution, for such birds had been known as vicious and untamable hunters\u2014but instead, she saw in his eyes a deep well of kinship. Quinn bound the eagle\u2019s broken pinion, and returned to Uwendale with him. She named him Valor, and the bond that formed between them rekindled the fire in Quinn\u2019s heart. Once more, her thoughts turned to serving Demacia in battle, as a knight.</p><p>Her mother reminded her that this would require sponsorship, and that was far beyond their family\u2019s humble means. But her father urged her to seek out Lady Buvelle, who had already offered recompense for service to her noble family, in the capital.</p><p>With his help, Quinn crafted a new weapon worthy of a knight, a finely wrought repeater crossbow capable of firing multiple bolts with a single pull of the trigger. Quinn and Valor then set out for the Great City together.</p><p>Lestara Buvelle gladly vouched for Quinn, even paying a personal visit to High Marshal Tianna Crownguard to petition for her. Within a week, Quinn took her oaths as a ranger-knight of Demacia.</p><p>Now, having brought renown to the rangers of Uwendale, she prefers to remain out in the hinterlands, never staying within the walls of the outlying towns for long. Quinn rarely pulls rank with the rangers who report to her, instead deferring to their specialized skills and experience in the field\u2014a stark departure from the rigid hierarchy of the rest of the military.</p><p>Quinn and Valor have ventured far and wide in service of Demacia, risking journeys into the icy Freljord and deep within Noxian-held territory. And with each mission, their unique bond has helped ensure the security of the kingdom\u2019s borders for generations to come.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>The Lhotlan vastaya once lived on the ancient, mystical borders of Ionia\u2019s deep forests, on the eastern island of Qaelin. It was a place where magic was breathed like air, and time had little meaning. To these chimeric creatures, the lands of mortals were an unforgiving desert, virtually devoid of magic\u2014and over the centuries, that desert only grew, encroaching on the vastaya\u2019s territories.</p><p>Rakan was born into a tribe in decline, yet he never gave up hope.</p><p>Like his brethren, Rakan watched as human settlements continued to expand, damming the flow of Ionia\u2019s wild, chaotic magic for their own safety. Many tribes sent emissaries to negotiate with them, securing treaties to protect the mystical energy the vastaya needed to thrive. Yet over and over again, these promises were broken.</p><p>Disillusioned, most vastaya became increasingly isolationist as they clung to their remaining lands. But young Rakan advocated a different path. The battle-dancer believed that mortals could be convinced to let wild magic run free if they could only appreciate its beauty, and he boasted that he was the one to make them see it. For this, he was labeled <i>mu\u2019takl</i>\u2014distrusted as a human sympathizer, and collaborator.</p><p>Rakan left the Lhotlan tribe, determined to spread the song of his people across Ionia. He was an entertaining rogue, a welcome performer at any tavern or village carnival, but over the years he realized that was <i>all</i> he was to mortals\u2014no matter how many dances and songs he performed, no matter how much he enthralled the crowds, he merely provided diversion to drunken revelers.</p><p>Rakan grew restless, finding himself without purpose... until he had a chance encounter with Xayah, a fellow Lhotlan, at the harvest festival in Vlonqo.</p><p>Seeing her in the crowd, Rakan sang one of his old songs, entrancing the entire town with his gleaming plumage. Though countless human and vastayan women had fallen for him in the past, this violet raven seemed immune to his charms, though not uninterested.</p><p>How could she see him and yet choose not to follow him? It was a puzzle with no easy answer.</p><p>Intrigued, the battle-dancer approached Xayah and asked after the welfare of their tribe. When she told him that the Lhotlan had lost the last of their lands, Rakan howled with rage. This finally seemed to impress Xayah, and she assured him that there was still hope: she was part of something greater, a rebellion of sorts, to take back what the vastaya had lost. Not just for the Lhotlan, but for all tribes.</p><p>Rakan was thunderstruck. Here was a chance for him to redeem his people, a cause he was willing to die for. He implored Xayah to let him accompany her, and she agreed\u2014as long as he carried his weight.</p><p>And, as Xayah would soon learn, Rakan\u2019s dances were as impressive in battle as they were on stage. He called himself the greatest battle-dancer in Lhotlan history, a boast that none could refute. His grand entrances and dazzling acrobatics distracted and befuddled enemies, before Xayah felled them with her razor-sharp quills. In any dangerous situation, they fought together with uncanny harmony.</p><p>During their travels, Rakan became fascinated by how Xayah interacted with the world. She seemed always prepared, aloof, and focused... whereas he was absent-minded, affable, and lacking seriousness. Although Rakan would often forget her carefully laid plans, he made up for it with his ability to read the emotions of others, using charisma and insight to persuade them. The two vastaya were so different, and yet they achieved great feats, each one\u2019s strengths complementing the other\u2019s weaknesses.</p><p>Soon enough, Rakan couldn\u2019t imagine life without Xayah, and it was clear that she felt the same for him. The pair pledged themselves to each other in the midst of a raucous tavern brawl.</p><p>Yet they did not see eye to eye in all things. Where she viewed the world as black and white, with mortals always the enemy, he had more compassion, and believed some of them were redeemable. Despite this difference, Rakan was certain that his and Xayah\u2019s love for each other would bear them through the storms that lay ahead.</p><p>Through Xayah, Rakan has found purpose. Inspired by his partner\u2019s singular drive, Rakan has made her crusade his own, and together they will fight to reclaim the First Lands for the vastaya.</p>",

Protected by a spiked shell, Rammus inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes - from demigod, to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the desert.</p><p>Some believe Rammus is an Ascended being, an ancient god amongst men who rolls to Shurima\u2019s aid as an armored guardian in its times of need. Superstitious folk swear he is a harbinger of change, appearing when the land is on the verge of a great shift in power. Others speculate he is the last of a dying species that roamed the land before the Rune Wars sundered the desert with uncontrolled magic.</p><p>With so many rumors of great power, magic, and mystery surrounding him, Rammus compels many Shurimans to seek his wisdom. Soothsayers, priests, and deranged lunatics alike claim to know where Rammus dwells, but the Armordillo has proved elusive. Despite this, proof of his presence predates living memory, with crumbling mosaics depicting his image on the most ancient walls of Shuriman ruins. His likeness adorns colossal stone monuments made in the early days of Ascension, leading some to believe he is no less than an immortal demigod. Skeptics often point to a simpler explanation: that Rammus is just one of many such creatures.</p><p>It is said that he appears only to worthy pilgrims in great need of his aid, and those blessed by his presence experience great turning points. After the Armordillo rescued the heir to a vast kingdom from a terrible fire, the man renounced his position to become a goat farmer. An elderly mason was inspired by a profound, yet brief conversation with Rammus, and constructed an enormous marketplace which became the bustling heart of Nashramae.</p><p>Knowing Rammus\u2019s guidance can pave an enlightened path, devout believers perform elaborate rituals designed to attract the favor of their deity. Disciples of the cult devoted to Rammus demonstrate their unwavering faith in a yearly ceremony by imitating his famous roll and somersaulting through the city in droves. Every year, thousands of Shurimans trek through the most treacherous and remote corners of the desert on a quest to find Rammus, for many teachings indicate he will answer a single question of those he finds deserving, if they are able to find him. Knowing his enthusiasm for desert treats, the pilgrims arm themselves with offerings thought to attract his blessing, packing their mules with flasks of sweet goat\u2019s milk, chests filled with colonies of ants sealed in wax, and jars of honeycombs. Many never return from the deep desert, and fewer still with stories of the demigod, though travelers describe waking to find their packs mysteriously emptied of all edible provisions. </p><p>Whether he is truly a wise oracle, Ascended deity, or a mighty beast, Rammus is known for his miraculous feats of endurance. He entered the impenetrable Fortress of Siram, an imposing bastion designed by a crazed sorcerer. The structure was said to contain untold magical horrors - fearsome beasts mutated beyond recognition, corridors wreathed in flames, impenetrable tunnels guarded by shadow demons. Not an hour had passed when the enormous fortress collapsed in a plume of dust, and Rammus was seen rolling away. None knew why Rammus entered the darkened gate, nor what secrets he learned within the basalt walls of the fortress. In the year of the great flood he crossed the vast lake of Imalli in just two days, and dug many miles deep to destroy a giant anthill and kill its queen, whose daughters had devastated the nearby farmland. </p><p>Sometimes he appears as a benevolent hero. When invading Noxian warbands attacked a Northern Shuriman settlement, disparate tribes banded together to defend the territory beneath the Temple of the Ascended. They were no match for the invaders in size or skill, and the battle was all but lost when Rammus entered the fray. Each side was so shocked to see the elusive creature that fighting halted completely as they watched him roll between them. As Rammus passed the towering temple, the foundations of the building shook, and enormous stone blocks toppled onto the invading army, crushing many of its warriors. Now outnumbered, the army retreated to elated cheers from the Shurimans. While many swear Rammus saved the town out of love for Shurima, others argue he was merely defending the territory in which his favorite cactus flowers grew. At least one tribesman claims Rammus was simply sleeprolling and had no intention of taking down a temple.</p><p>Whatever the truth, stories of Rammus are treasured by the people of Shurima. Any Shuriman child can list a dozen theories on the question of his origin, half of which they likely invented on the spot. Tales of the Armordillo have only increased with the rise of Ancient Shurima, as they did just before its fall, giving way to a belief that his presence heralds darker times to come. </p><p>But how can such a benevolent, epicurean soul herald an age of destruction? </p>",

Even some within the steeled ranks of the Trifarian Legion have begun to worry that they will be sent after her to their almost certain deaths.</p><p>What kind of monster could be behind such heinous, unchecked destruction?</p><p>The simple answer is a sixteen-year-old girl.</p><p>The complicated one is unforgivable.</p><p>Rell was special from the moment of her birth\u2014and fated to suffer for it. Born the daughter of a Noxian footsoldier and the heir to a fallen noble house, she enjoyed neither the trappings of wealth nor the gilded upbringing common to children of the lower aristocracy. Nevertheless, her parents had grand plans to mold her into someone who could shatter through Noxus\u2019 dense political landscape. As Rell\u2019s mother always said, \u201cExcellence is measured in sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Rell\u2019s unhappiness grew with time, sparking something unique within her\u2014a magic unlike anything seen in centuries: the ability to manipulate metal. To Rell\u2019s parents, this was something to be exploited\u2014for Rell\u2019s own sake, of course!\u2014and they tried unsuccessfully to apprentice her with many powerful mages who might whisk their daughter into the political or military elite.</p><p>But someone else took notice of the young girl\u2019s magic. Seeing in Rell a weapon who could one day face Noxus\u2019 most hated, ancient foe, a certain pale woman visited the family with a dark bargain. Rell soon found herself the star pupil of a very special academy, hidden far from the capital and away from the council\u2019s prying eyes. And though they rarely made appearances in her new boarding school, her mother and father never seemed more proud or more hopeful of their daughter\u2019s future.</p><p>It seemed, at least for a moment, that perhaps Rell would be loved after all.</p><p>Then the true horrors began.</p><p>Rell was first forced into combat with another student when she was eight, and, afterward, a kind of magic sigil was painfully grafted into her arm, amplifying her powers so that she could become even stronger. Yet while this had been framed as a training exercise, Rell never saw the boy again. She never saw any of her opponents again.</p><p>Every day, she grew more powerful, honing her magic for martial combat. Her body became covered with sigils that amplified her magical abilities to impossible heights. In time, she could rip a vein of raw ore from deep out of the ground, twist the walls into deadly weapons, and superheat an opponent\u2019s armor until it collapsed and crushed them. But her instructors desired even more from her\u2014all in the hopes that Rell would be the most powerful soldier the empire had ever known.</p><p>On her sixteenth birthday, after a particularly barbaric duel, she\u2019d finally had enough. Casting her instructors aside, Rell tore past the guards and ripped open the doors of a forbidden wing of the academy, discovering the true nature of her school: Every opponent she\u2019d defeated had been Nullified\u2014their magic forcibly extracted from them and placed into the very sigils covering Rell\u2019s body\u2014and left as emotionless puppets devoid of memories. This was the price of her power, and she could never give it back.</p><p>Worst of all was the headmistress who oversaw the procedures herself: Rell\u2019s own mother. All of this had been for Rell, she said. After all... excellence is measured in sacrifice.</p><p>Rell raged.</p><p>To the small handful of faculty who survived her escape from the academy, it was like the earth had been torn open into a twisting whirlwind of razor-sharp slag. The building ripped itself apart, forming an impenetrable suit of black armor around Rell as she crushed those who stood before her, flattening seasoned soldiers with a lance heavier than a mountain. Bursting through the front gate on a steed made of rippling iron, she led as many of her classmates as she could to freedom\u2014leaving the Rose scrambling to recover the Null and erase any trace of what their organization had done.</p><p>But it was far too late. Soon enough, the surviving faculty members began to die in increasingly public ways, and the Null could no longer be kept secret.</p><p>Rell is now a threat to Noxus, but not in the way the handbills proclaim. She is a self-styled defender of the meek, full of unchecked fury, distrustful of everyone, and merciless toward a government that turned a blind eye to years of suffering and abuse. Not because the empire was personally responsible\u2014but because they stood by and did nothing.</p><p>Riding atop her iron steed, Rell\u2019s eyes are set on nothing less than the complete destruction of Noxus and saving any children who, like her, survived the Black Rose academy.</p><p>And there is nothing in this world that can stop her.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Renekton was born to fight. From a young age, it was obvious he had no fear, regularly brawling with much older children. It was usually his pride that led to these confrontations\u2014Renekton was unable to back down, or let any insult pass. While his older brother, Nasus, disapproved of his street-fighting, Renekton relished it.</p><p>Nasus eventually left to join the prestigious Collegium of the Sun, and Renekton\u2019s skirmishes became more serious. Fearing his brother\u2019s violent nature would see him imprisoned or in an early grave, Nasus helped him enlist in the Shuriman army. Officially, Renekton was too young, but Nasus made sure this was conveniently overlooked.</p><p>The discipline of military life was a blessing. Renekton fought in numerous wars of conquest to expand the empire\u2014his ferocity and toughness were still evident, but his honor and bravery became renowned. Nasus, now a celebrated general and tactician, would often say that he planned many great battles, but it was Renekton who <i>won</i> them.</p><p>Indeed, after saving the isolated city of Zuretta, Renekton was made a captain by the emperor himself, and named Gatekeeper of Shurima. Outnumbered ten to one, he and a small contingent had faced the enemy in the remote, rocky passes to the south, to buy time for the city to be evacuated. It was a battle none had expected Renekton to survive, let alone win... yet he held out long enough for a relief force led by Nasus to arrive, and the invading forces were routed.</p><p>Through decades of service, Renekton\u2019s reputation came to rival even the god-warriors of the Ascended Host, his presence on the battlefield an inspiration to those fighting alongside him, and terrifying to his foes. Still, he was a grizzled and battle-scarred veteran of middling years when word reached him that his brother was close to death.</p><p>He raced back to the capital to find Nasus a pale shadow of his former self, having been struck down by a debilitating wasting malady. The sickness was incurable.</p><p>Nevertheless, the general\u2019s greatness was recognized by one and all. Beyond his military acumen, Nasus had curated the empire\u2019s great libraries, and compiled or translated many of the finest literary works of antiquity. Such a man could not be allowed to pass, and it was decreed that he was worthy of Ascension.</p><p>The whole city gathered in witness, but Nasus no longer had the strength to climb onto the dais before the Sun Disc. Without thought for his own safety, Renekton lifted his brother in his arms, and climbed the final steps, fully expecting to be obliterated in the process. He was just a warrior, after all, and he knew Shurima would need Nasus in the years to come.</p><p>However, Renekton was not destroyed. Beneath the blinding radiance of the Sun Disc, both brothers were raised up and remade, and when the light faded, <i>two</i> mighty god-warriors stood before the crowds\u2014Nasus in his lean, jackal-headed body, and Renekton as an immense reptile. The jackal was often regarded as the most clever and cunning of beasts, and the fearless aggression of the crocodile fit Renekton perfectly.</p><p>Renekton had been a mighty hero before, but now he possessed power beyond mortal understanding. He led Shurima\u2019s armies to many bloody victories, neither giving nor expecting any mercy. His legend spread far beyond the borders of the empire, and it was his enemies that knew him as \u201cthe Butcher of the Sands\u201d, a title he embraced.</p><p>But there were some\u2014Nasus among them\u2014who came to believe that a portion of Renekton\u2019s humanity had been lost in his transformation. He seemed crueler, taking ever greater pleasure in the spilling of blood, and there were whispers of many battlefield atrocities. Nevertheless, he remained a staunch defender of Shurima, faithfully serving a succession of emperors, even through the rebellion of Icathia and the horrifying war that followed.</p><p>Some years later, it was decided that the young emperor Azir would join the ranks of the Ascended Host, and become the immortal ruler his people deserved.</p><p>The results were catastrophic.</p><p>Renekton and Nasus were each more than a day\u2019s journey from the capital when it happened, and they arrived to find the glorious city in ruins. The Sun Disc was failing, drained of all its power. At the center of the carnage, they found the emperor\u2019s treacherous magus, Xerath\u2014now a malevolent being of pure energy.</p><p>The brothers fought hard, but knowing that they could not destroy Xerath, Renekton finally wrestled him into the Tomb of the Emperors beneath the city, and bade his brother seal them inside. Knowing there was no other way, Nasus reluctantly did as his brother ordered.</p><p>Xerath and Renekton continued their battle. For uncounted centuries they stalked one another through the lightless depths, as the once-great civilization of Shurima turned to dust in the world above. Xerath taunted his adversary, whispering poison in Renekton\u2019s ear, and gradually, his viperous words began to take hold. He convinced Renekton that Nasus, jealous of his success, had leapt at the chance to be rid of him, and enjoy immortality alone.</p><p>Piece by piece, Renekton\u2019s sanity cracked. Xerath drove a wedge into these cracks, twisting his perception of what was real and what was imagined. When the Tomb of the Emperors was finally opened by greedy mortal scavengers, Renekton roared his fury and thundered out into the desert, sniffing the air for his brother\u2019s scent.</p><p>But Shurima has changed much in his absence. The Ascended Host is no more, leaving the people scattered and leaderless, for the most part. Though he cares little for such things, Renekton has attracted followers among the most fierce and bloodthirsty of the desert raiders... even if he cannot always tell friend from foe in his frequent, deranged frenzies.</p><p>And while there are moments when he resembles the proud, honorable hero of the past, most often Renekton is little more than a devolved, hate-maddened beast, driven on by the thirst for blood and vengeance.</p>",

Once, he was his empire\u2019s most esteemed champion, leading its grand armies to countless victories. However, after the fall of the Sun Disc, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands\u2014and slowly, as the world above changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with wreaking vengeance upon his brother, Nasus, who he blames for the centuries lost in darkness.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Rengar hails from a tribe of Shuriman vastaya known as the Kiilash, whose society venerated the honor and glory of the hunt. Rengar was born the runt of the litter to the tribe's chieftain, Ponjaf. Ponjaf believed Rengar's diminutive size would make him a worthless hunter. He ignored his child, assuming the runt would starve to death.</p><p>Eventually, the young Rengar fled the camp, ashamed that he had disappointed his father. He subsisted on grubs and plants for weeks until, one day, he was nearly killed by a legendary human hunter named Markon. Upon seeing Rengar's state, he took pity on the creature and let it live. Besides, this was no mighty vastayan warrior worthy of Markon's blade.</p><p>Rengar spent months following Markon, feeding off the corpses the hunter left behind. He still hoped to one day rejoin his tribe, and so took great care in observing how Markon took down his quarries.</p><p>After some time, Markon grew sick of the pathetic Kiilash following him around. He put a knife to Rengar's throat and informed him that the only way to be a hunter was to hunt. He tossed Rengar the blade and kicked him down a ravine, where he was forced to make his first kill to survive.</p><p>From then on, Rengar spent years pushing himself almost to breaking point. He scoured Shurima for the most powerful and dangerous prey. Though he would never be as big as other Kiilash, Rengar was determined to be twice as ferocious. Over time, instead of coming back to his camp each time with fresh scars, he began to come back with trophies. He polished a sandhawk's skull to a sheen; he braided the teeth of a shrieker into his hair.</p><p>Then, when he decided the time had come, Rengar returned to his tribe, ready to be accepted as a true hunter.</p><p>Ponjaf scoffed at Rengar and his trophies. He decreed that only by bringing back the head of the elusive and legendary Void-abomination known as Kha'Zix would Rengar be welcomed back into the tribe.</p><p>Blinded by his eagerness, Rengar allowed this cunning beast to get the drop on him. The Void creature ripped out one of Rengar's eyes and escaped. Furious and defeated, Rengar admitted his failure to Ponjaf. As expected, his father chastised him.</p><p>But as Ponjaf spoke, Rengar noticed all the trophies adorning his father's hut were dusty and old. The chieftain had not hunted anything in a long time\u2014he had likely sent Rengar after Kha'Zix because he was too afraid to do it himself.</p><p>Rengar interrupted his father and called him a coward. Many Kiilash were blessed with strong bodies or comfortable homes. Rengar, conversely, was born facing death. He had taught himself how to hunt, and had the trophies and scars to prove it. Even his own bloody eye socket was a trophy: proof that though Rengar was born with disadvantages, he never gave up.</p><p>Rengar leapt onto his father and gutted him from neck to belly. The fiercest hunters of the tribe crowned him with flame-roses, marking him as their new chieftain.</p><p>But Rengar didn't need his village's acceptance. All he needed was adrenaline pumping through his veins as he chased down his prey. He left the village, without even pausing to take a trophy from what was left of Ponjaf\u2014his father was not a kill worthy of remembering. Instead, he set off determined to find and slay the Void creature that had tried to blind him.</p><p>Not to satisfy the Kiilash, but to satisfy himself.</p>",

Her father lost to an unnamed battle and her mother to the girl\u2019s own stubborn birth, Riven was raised on a farm run by the empire on the rocky hillsides of Trevale.</p><p>Physical strength and ferocious will kept the children alive and working on the hard scrap of land, but Riven hungered for more than simply bread on the table. She watched conscriptors from regional warbands visiting the farms, year after year, and in them, she saw a chance at the life she dreamed of. When she finally pledged the empire her strength, she knew Noxus would embrace her as the daughter she longed to be.</p><p>Riven proved a natural soldier. Young as she was, her years of hard labor allowed her to quickly master the weight of a longsword taller than herself. Her new family was forged in the heat of battle, and Riven saw her bond to her brothers- and sisters-in-arms as unbreakable.</p><p>So exceptional was her dedication to the empire, that Boram Darkwill himself recognized her with a runic blade of dark metal, enchanted by a pale sorceress within his court. The weapon was heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad\u2014perfectly suited to Riven\u2019s tastes.</p><p>Not long after, the warhosts set sail for Ionia as part of the long-planned Noxian invasion.</p><p>As this new war dragged on, it became clear that Ionia would not kneel. Riven\u2019s unit was assigned to escort another warband making its way through the embattled province of Navori. The warband\u2019s leader, Emystan, had employed a Zaunite alchymist, eager to test a new kind of weapon. Across countless campaigns, Riven would gladly have given her life for Noxus, but now she saw something awry in these other soldiers\u2014something that made her deeply uncomfortable. The fragile amphorae they carried on their wagons had no purpose on any battlefield she could imagine...</p><p>The two warbands met increasingly fierce resistance, as if even the land itself sought to defy them. During a heavy rain storm, with mud pouring down the hillsides, Riven and her warriors were stranded with their deadly cargo\u2014and it was then that the Ionian fighters revealed themselves. Seeing the danger, Riven called to Emystan for support.</p><p>The only answer she received was a flaming arrow, fired out from the ridgeline, and Riven understood this was no longer a war to expand the borders of Noxus. It was to be a complete annihilation of the enemy, no matter the cost.</p><p>The wagon was hit straight on. Instinctively, Riven drew her sword, but it was too late to protect anyone but herself. Chemical fire burst from the ruptured containers, and screams filled the night\u2014both Ionian and Noxian falling victim to an agonizing, gruesome death. Shielded from the scorching, poisonous mists by the magic of her blade, she bore unwilling witness to scenes of horror and betrayal that would haunt her forever.</p><p>For Riven, memories of the hours that followed come only in fragments, and nightmares. She bound her wounds. She mourned the dead. But, most of all, she came to hate the sword that saved her life. The words carved into its surface mocked her, reminding her of all she had lost. She would find a way to break it, severing her last tie to Noxus, before the dawn.</p><p>But when the blade was finally shattered, still she found no peace.</p><p>Stripped of the faith and conviction that had bolstered her entire life, Riven chose to exile herself, wandering Ionia\u2019s battle-scarred landscape. When she finally returned to the village where she had broken the sword, it was revealed that her self-destructive needs had cost the life of their most revered elder... and yet Ionia embraced her with forgiveness.</p><p>Noxus was not nearly so merciful. Although the empire had long since withdrawn from the First Lands, it had not forgotten about Riven, or her runic blade. After fighting fiercely against those sent to bring her to justice, she refused to let any more Ionian blood be shed on her account, and surrendered herself to the charges of desertion leveled against her.</p><p>As she returns to Noxus in chains, Riven remains haunted. Though Darkwill is no more, and the empire is rumored to have evolved, she is uncertain what will become of her, or whether she will ever be made whole again.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Once a swordmaster in the warhosts of Noxus, Riven rose through the ranks on the strength of her conviction and brutal efficiency, and was rewarded with a legendary runic blade and a warband of her own. However, on the Ionian front, Riven\u2019s faith in her nation was tested and ultimately broken. She severed all ties to the empire, seeking to find her place in a shattered world, even as rumors abounded that Noxus had been reforged. Now forced to return in chains, she faces the judgment of her former homeland...",

Ryze overheard Tyrus speaking in hushed tones with another mage, discussing something called \u201cWorld Runes.\u201d When Tyrus noticed his apprentice, he abruptly ended the conversation, tightly clutching the scroll that never left his side.</p><p>In spite of the order\u2019s best efforts, knowledge of the Runes began to spread\u2014few could even begin to understand their importance, or the sheer power held within them, and yet <i>all</i> saw them as weapons that could be turned against their rivals. Ryze and Tyrus traveled between the various peoples of Valoran, trying to quell paranoia and encourage restraint. But over time, their missions became increasingly precarious, and Ryze could sense his master\u2019s growing desperation. Finally, in the Noxii territories where Ryze was born, the first cataclysmic blow was struck in what would eventually be known as the Rune Wars.</p><p>Two nations were pitted against one another, and tensions were running high. Tyrus pleaded with their leaders in parley at the village of Khom, but he saw this conflict had already escalated beyond his ability to mediate. Fleeing into the hills, he and Ryze bore horrified witness to the destructive power of the World Runes firsthand.</p><p>The earth fell away beneath them, the bedrock itself seeming to retch and squeal, while the sky above them recoiled as if mortally wounded. They looked back upon the valley where the rival armies had stood, and beheld insanity\u2014destruction on a scale so massive that it defied all physical sense. The buildings, the people, all were gone, and the ocean, once a day\u2019s journey to the east, now rushed to meet them.</p><p>Ryze fell to his knees and stared into the great hole torn in the world. Nothing remained. Not even the village he once called home.</p><p>Open warfare soon raged across Runeterra. Ryze felt compelled to join the conflict, to pick a side and lend his magical strength to the cause, but Tyrus stayed his hand. The two of them had to guide others back toward peace, and pray there was anything left of the world by the time it was all over.</p><p>Wherever they met those who held the World Runes, Tyrus pleaded for restraint. Many were deeply sobered by the threat of total annihilation\u2014indeed, those who had already suffered most bitterly in the war might have agreed to turn over their Runes to him, and yet none of them wished to be the first to do so.</p><p>As time passed and the conflict spread, Ryze noticed his master growing more distant. While Tyrus attended clandestine meetings with great leaders and archmages, he sent his apprentice on errands that seemed of little importance, often for many weeks at a time. Eventually, Ryze decided to confront him and, to his horror, discovered that Tyrus of Helia had secretly come into possession of not one Rune, but <i>two</i>.</p><p>Bitter and angry, the older mage insisted that common mortals were like reckless children, toying with powers they did not understand. He would no longer play diplomat to ignorant power-mongers. He had to stop them. Ryze tried to reason with Tyrus, but it was no use\u2014before him stood a flawed man, susceptible to the same temptations as those he decried. The allure of the Runes had left its mark upon him. Where once he desired only peace, now he had the means to bring about the end of all things. Ryze had to act, even if it meant destroying his only true friend and ally in the world.</p><p>In an instant, he unleashed all the magic he could muster. A moment later, Tyrus\u2019s corpse lay smoldering on the floor.</p><p>Ryze trembled as his mind struggled to process what he had done. If these deadly artifacts could corrupt a mage with the strength and integrity of Tyrus, how was Ryze to handle them? At the same time, he knew he could not entrust them to any other living soul...</p><p>Soon, the greatest civilizations all but destroyed one another, ending the war. Ryze now understood the task he had inherited\u2014as long as any World Rune remained unsecured, Runeterra was surely doomed. This knowledge was to become a lonely burden indeed, for ever since that day he has scoured the world in search of the last remaining Runes. He continues to reject the promise of power within each one, choosing instead to bind them in secret locations, far from prying and greedy eyes.</p><p>Even with his life abnormally prolonged by the magic he is exposed to, Ryze cannot afford to rest, for rumors of the World Runes have begun to emerge once more, and the peoples of Runeterra seem to have forgotten the price of wielding them.<br></p>",

He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra.",

                "lore_full": "<p>In the city of Amakra, on the eastern edge of the Great Sai, Samira and her parents made a living as street performers. They dazzled, beguiled, and awed onlookers, which thrilled Samira, but worried her parents. Despite the fun their daughter had, they wished she could enjoy a more stable life.</p><p>But wishes are as fickle as the desert rain.</p><p>On the eve of Samira\u2019s fourteenth birthday, armed strangers swarmed Amakra. Hidden among the rafters of her home, Samira watched as the strangers invoked the name of an ancient magus and seized innocent villagers. Many people were slain before her eyes.</p><p>Samira did not cry. She did not scream. Instead, she seethed in anger\u2014not at the killers, but at herself for hiding. She had never felt crippled by fear before, even when she attempted the most daring stunts. In that moment, Samira hated herself, and vowed never to feel so scared and helpless again.</p><p>Though wounded, Samira and her parents escaped to Bel\u2019zhun, a port city under Noxian rule, with a handful of others. To the Amakrans, Noxus provided a safe haven. To Samira, Noxus opened a door.</p><p>While other refugees found comfort in living quietly, Samira was determined to reclaim her courage. She took to the streets alone since her parents, weary and injured, could not. Performing was no longer a job\u2014it was her stage to be fearless. She outdid herself with every stunt, even when no one bothered to look. But it was still not enough to support her family.</p><p>That was when Samira stumbled upon a call to join a Noxian warband. Drawn to the excitement and the financial resources it would provide, she enlisted.</p><p>Her physical prowess amazed her peers. Deft with a blade and sharp with her aim, Samira reveled in her raw athleticism, excelling in combat\u2026 but faltering in discipline. After two years of training, her recklessness frustrated her commanding officers, save for one: Captain Indari. A former saboteur, Indari valued Samira\u2019s fearlessness and offered her a position in her private warband\u2014a specialized unit charged with missions that were deemed too perilous for standard military personnel. Hungry for the dangers it promised, Samira agreed without hesitation.</p><p>She fully embraced Noxian culture, finding her own strength and style amid life-and-death shootouts and breathtaking sword fights. In her free time, Samira regaled her family with stories of her tattoos, each representing only her most unforgettable feats. To her, what mattered most was challenging herself to turn danger into thrill, and thriving off the constant risk that made her feel truly alive.</p><p>On orders from the capital, Indari\u2019s unit found themselves on the Rokrund Plains, sent to crush a secessionist uprising. As the warband located the enemy stronghold and approached the rebel leader, the fortress exploded. Samira dove headfirst into the chaos as the structure collapsed, permanently injuring her right eye. Feeling neither scared nor helpless, she wasted no time in recovering Indari, who had sustained a more serious injury\u2014the captain could no longer move her legs. Indari, frustrated at her failure as their leader, disbanded the unit upon the return of its survivors.</p><p>Discharged, and with no other opportunities rousing her interest, Samira drifted back home to Bel\u2019zhun\u2014but it was no longer a lifestyle she could endure.</p><p>Samira returned to the Noxian capital and located Indari. She believed her former captain understood her craving for challenges in ways nobody else could, and wanted to make use of Indari\u2019s connections in the military and noble houses. She proposed they team up again in a new partnership, where Indari could operate behind the scenes to find Samira high-stakes mercenary work.</p><p>Reluctantly, Indari agreed, but it left her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 alone with no field support\u2026</p><p>And Samira couldn\u2019t have been happier. She eagerly undertook missions meant for entire warbands\u2014and thrived.</p><p>Her daredevil reputation spread far and wide. From beating a chem-baron in hand-to-hand combat, to being the lone survivor of a Bilgewater raid, Samira completed every job no matter the odds. With Indari\u2019s support, even the Noxian high command accepted her, recognizing there was no one better suited to take on their most perilous missions.</p><p>Now, Samira shows no signs of slowing down. She can be found scaling mountain cliffs one day, and arm-wrestling outlaws in crowded taverns the next. But wherever she may be, one thing is certain: Samira never fails to find her next big thrill.</p>",

Her mother, the Iceborn warrior Kalkia of the Winter\u2019s Claw, abandoned her new family to pursue the man who had captured her heart years before, and the tribe fell into decline and chaos without a young Warmother to lead it.</p><p>Sejuani was instead raised by her grandmother, Hejian. Though Sejuani tried her best to earn Hejian\u2019s love, she was never able to meet her arduous expectations. As the tribe\u2019s troubles grew in the years that followed, Hejian had even less time for the girl.</p><p>Wealth, love, safety\u2014these were things Sejuani only experienced secondhand, through visits to the Winter\u2019s Claw\u2019s sister tribe, the Avarosans. During the summers, Grena, the most famous warrior in the region, took Sejuani into her household. After discovering Grena had in fact once bested Kalkia in a duel, the Avarosan Warmother instantly became Sejuani\u2019s idol\u2026 and Grena\u2019s daughter Ashe became the only person she ever truly considered a friend.</p><p>After Grena questioned the treatment of the young girl by her grandmother, an affronted Hejian cut all ties with the Avarosans. The Winter\u2019s Claw then instigated a series of conflicts with other neighboring tribes, attempting to reclaim the lands and honor they had lost with Kalkia\u2019s flight, but these desperate tactics only led them further into ruin.</p><p>Somehow, word of this reached Kalkia.</p><p>Hearing of her former tribe\u2019s misfortunes, she returned and took up the mantle of Warmother once more. Even so, quelling these hostilities left the Winter\u2019s Claw with game-poor lands and precious few other resources, forcing them to rely on the grim Frostguard for protection.</p><p>Sejuani was galled by this, and resolved to seize leadership from her mother. She swore a sacred oath to lead a perilous raid against a Noxian warship, hoping that fulfilling this oath would be enough to rally the tribe to her, with enough support to wrest power from Kalkia and the Frost Priests.</p><p>During the vicious assault, Sejuani freed a juvenile dr\u00fcvask from the ship\u2019s butchery stores, naming it Bristle for the feel of its hide.

                "lore_full": "<p>Senna\u2019s journey to become a Sentinel of Light started with darkness. It started with the Black Mist\u2026</p><p>Senna first encountered the Mist at an early age, when wreckage from a distant Harrowing washed onto the shores of her home island. The Black Mist within the wreckage awakened upon contact with life. She and her village survived the ensuing storm of souls, thanks to the intervention of a nearby Sentinel\u2026 but in the wake of the attack, the Mist was still mysteriously drawn to Senna.</p><p>She was cursed, marked by the Mist so its horrors pursued her endlessly, the darkness drawn to her like dying moth to living flame. She could never know when it would strike next\u2014but worse was when it didn\u2019t come, and Senna had to imagine what awaited in every shadow. </p><p>The Sentinel who saved Senna, a brusque veteran named Urias, did not understand why the Mist was drawn to a solitary girl\u2014but he knew if she was going to survive, she had to learn to fight back. And so, Senna joined Urias in the Sentinels of Light, a sacred order that could be traced back to the Blessed Isles, where the Black Mist originated. She proved to be a deadly enemy of darkness, mastering the relic-stone pistol Urias gave her, learning to channel her soul into light.</p><p>Yet even as Senna grew comfortable working with Urias, relying on him for gruff guidance, she learned to keep others at gun\u2019s length. If she allowed them to get too close, they would only be hurt when the Mist came again. Senna could never stay in one place for long, something she and Urias learned when those who offered them shelter inevitably found themselves under siege. After even Urias was slain, Senna wasn\u2019t sure if she could let anyone get close again.</p><p>Reluctantly, Senna sought out Urias\u2019 family in Demacia, to tell them of his fate. There, she met his son, Lucian, who would not relent until Senna allowed him to join Urias\u2019 parting vigil. From the very first moment she found herself flustered, wondering if her walls were enough to keep out someone so stubborn, full of humor and love. It became clear over time that Lucian\u2019s place was with the Sentinels, as Senna\u2019s partner, and Senna as his. </p><p>The more they served together, the deeper their bond became, and Senna realized that the value of her walls wasn\u2019t what she kept out, but who she let in. Yet as Lucian\u2019s love for Senna grew, so did his desire to save her from her curse. In time, it became his only focus, the light in his eyes passing into his gun\u2014making Senna wary that Lucian would only see sorrow where there was love.</p><p>It was while researching a cure that Senna and Lucian came into conflict with the sadistic wraith Thresh. So close to answering mysteries about the Ruination and Senna\u2019s curse, Lucian refused to turn back\u2026 </p><p>Thresh\u2019s chains whipped toward Senna as she stood between the wraith and her husband. More painful than the scythe was seeing the look of anguish on Lucian\u2019s face. With her last breath, Senna screamed for Lucian to run.</p><p>But as Senna felt the deathblow and knew she had lost, she realized there was a glimmer of hope. Her whole life, the Mist had haunted her\u2014she didn\u2019t need to fear it anymore. She could ride it into the darkness of Thresh\u2019s lantern, and see what was inside. </p><p>Her curse had become her only chance for salvation.</p><p>While Lucian spent years seeking to grant his beloved peace, Senna explored her spectral prison. She learned that life had been the origin of her curse. Its spark shone brighter within her than in anyone else\u2014she\u2019d been infected with it when she first encountered the wreckage that brought the Harrowing. There, she\u2019d been touched by a powerful, lingering soul, given its unnatural life\u2026 </p><p>It was <i>life</i> that the Black Mist could never let go.</p><p>She could use this force to pull the Mist into herself, empowering her to sever its hold over others in the lantern. Among the souls she freed were Sentinels who possessed lost knowledge of the Ruination\u2019s origins, of her curse\u2026 and the love that created it.</p><p>When Lucian drove his broken pistol into the lantern, intending to end the torture of the souls within, Senna was waiting. She escaped, shrouded in Mist she\u2019d drawn from other souls. She was dead, but also <i>alive</i>, thanks to her curse, wielding a relic-stone cannon that could channel darkness along with light, forged from the weapons of fallen Sentinels.</p><p>No longer running from the Mist, Senna now understands the suffering of the souls within. Though it is painful, she draws their Mist into herself, liberating them, and blasting darkness with darkness. Embracing her death every time she transforms into a wraith, she becomes like those she fought, only to be reborn again thanks to the life infecting her. </p><p>Though Senna and Lucian\u2019s love survived even death, now they face the consequences of her rebirth. Senna knows what they have to do next, a secret gleaned within the lantern. </p><p>Find the Ruined King, and stop him at any cost\u2026</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>In Piltover, where anyone\u2019s dream can become everyone\u2019s progress, a star is born.</p><p>As a child, Seraphine always loved music, especially her father\u2019s lullabies. The songs were beautiful, but sad. He\u2019d brought them up to Piltover as he and Seraphine\u2019s mother\u2014two lifelong Zaunites\u2014sought a better life in the City of Progress.</p><p>Leaning out the window of their hexcoustics workshop, where broken sound tech was made to play again, Seraphine sang along with the streets. The shanties of the Sun Gates, the whistling of apprentices, even the melody of conversation\u2014in a bustling city like Piltover, she was never alone.</p><p>Over time, Seraphine realized she could sense songs too private, too personal, for any ordinary person to hear. And as she grew, so did the intensity of her gifts. She heard every person\u2019s soul, loving or cruel\u2014turning the streets she\u2019d once loved into an overwhelming cacophony of conflicting desires. How could she make sense of the voices if none of them harmonized? Some days, she hid shivering in a corner, hands over her ears, unable to hear herself above the chaos.</p><p>Seraphine\u2019s parents had left everything behind so she could be born in Piltover; they couldn\u2019t bear seeing her struggle. Scraping together their savings to purchase a shard of a rare hextech crystal, they crafted a device that dampened her magical hearing. For the first time in years, there was silence.</p><p>Within that quiet, though, Seraphine heard something\u2014some<i>one</i>. The crystal had a consciousness, born of brackern blood. Though hard to hear, and harder to comprehend, the voice was kind. In a hymn of distant deserts and ancient conflicts of ancestors, a thousand years of history sang in unison.</p><p>Seraphine, awed, asked for guidance. Overwhelmed by the yearnings around her, she worried she may have no song of her own. What if she was merely the voices of others?</p><p><i>\u201cWe are all forged through others\u2019 voices,\u201d</i> the presence sang back.</p><p>And slowly, she learned to manage the noise. The voice rarely spoke clearly, but Seraphine felt its influence as it helped her understand how to resonate with a crowd, to sing <i>with</i> them, using her dampener less each day. The first time she performed in front of an audience, testing her skills, she was nervous beyond words. But she kept singing, and the crowds swelled. Soon, the biggest venues in Piltover had Seraphine\u2019s fans spilling into the streets. Still, something was missing\u2014in the crowds, and in herself. She resolved to seek perspective in the city her parents had worked so hard to leave: Zaun.</p><p>The first time she rode the clanging lift down, Seraphine felt somehow at home but still a stranger. In Zaun, she heard refrains of resilience and ambition much like above, yet with a thrum of freedom that was all their own. But as she spent more time below, she also sensed pain. Fear of the chem-barons who controlled every opportunity. Hatred of the spoiled, arrogant Pilties above. There was so much discord. She began to perform, and listened to these new crowds, their hearts singing their struggles. The two cities were divided by more than simple misunderstanding. She wanted to mend, to unite. But she kept hearing the same refrain: \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple in Zaun.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, Piltover started to feel less like home.</p><p>Her hextech crystal had sung an elegy of what hatred left unchecked could accomplish. Seraphine couldn\u2019t let that happen to the cities she loved. Persuading her parents to help, she dismantled her dampener, and together, they gave the crystal a new home in its opposite\u2014a platform that would amplify her gifts, not repress them, allowing her to hear others in all their complexity. Seraphine hoped the crystal\u2019s voice would be among them. She rode this platform down as a stage of sorts, stepping out onto the Entresol between Piltover and Zaun. As the crowds gathered and the lights dazzled, she heard citizens from both worlds, mingled together to hear her.</p><p>This was a new song. Not just understanding\u2014<i>unity</i>.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t perfect. It might never be. But her voice mattered. And so, Seraphine realized, maybe she could help others find their voice, too.</p><p>Seraphine has become the premier star in both Piltover and Zaun. Empowered by her gifts and her hextech, she amplifies the voices of all with a fresh force of optimism, because to her, everyone deserves to be heard\u2014especially those who are struggling. They inspire her, and she will do her best to inspire them in return.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Though now a powerful player in Ionia\u2019s flourishing criminal underworld, Sett had humble origins. Born from an Ionian vastaya and a Noxian human, the \u201chalf-beast\u201d child was an outcast from the start. His birth appalled his mother\u2019s vastayan community, which expelled the family for violating its tribal norms. The humans of Ionia were no more accepting of the taboo union, though Sett\u2019s father\u2019s infamy as a local pitfighter usually kept them from voicing their disapproval.</p><p>What little security the family enjoyed vanished the day Sett\u2019s father disappeared. All of a sudden, those who had bitten their tongues at the sight of young Sett felt free to express their contempt. The boy was bewildered, wondering where his father had gone, and why trouble suddenly seemed to be following him.</p><p>Sett grew up quickly, becoming calloused in the face of the taunts and threats he endured, and before long, he began using his fists to silence the insults. When news of his fights reached his mother, she made him swear not to go near the Noxian pits where his father had fought.</p><p>But the more Sett fought, the more he thought of his father.</p><p>Longing to find the man he only vaguely remembered, Sett snuck away to the pit late one night, after his mother had gone to bed. Immediately, he was enthralled by the spectacle. Scores of Noxian soldiers, fresh to the shores of Ionia, roared with bloodlust from the stands around him. Down in the center of the arena, fighters from all backgrounds and martial disciplines clashed in gruesome duels with a variety of weapons\u2014the winners handsomely paid in Noxian coin. When the event was over, Sett inquired about his father, and learned a hard truth: his father had bought out his contract and left to tour more profitable pits abroad. He had deserted his family, to seek fortune on the other side of the world.</p><p>Burning with rage, Sett asked the arena\u2019s matchmaker for a fight, hoping that somehow his father would return from his tour\u2014and be the opponent standing across the pit from him. The matchmaker assigned the boy a fight on the next card, figuring he would be easy fodder for one of his star combatants.</p><p>Sett would prove him wrong.</p><p>From the moment he threw his first punch, \u201cThe Beast-Boy Bastard\u201d was a pit-fighting sensation. Though Sett had no formal martial arts training, his primal strength and ferocity more than compensated, and he leveled his more technically sound opponents like a battering ram. Never abandoning hope that he might one day fight his father, he soon became the undisputed \u201cKing of the Pit\u201d, with a swollen coffer of prize money\u2014and a trail of broken opponents\u2014to his name.</p><p>Night after night, Sett brought money and comforts to his mother, always lying about how he had acquired them. It warmed his calloused heart to see her so proud of his success, no longer forced to toil at menial jobs. Still, Sett couldn\u2019t help but feel he could do better. Being the King of the Pit was good, but being the person who owned the pit\u2026 that was where the real money was.</p><p>Late one night, after defending his title in front of a record-breaking crowd, Sett presented his new demands to the Noxian matchmaker and his cronies. He suggested they grant him control of the arena and its revenue. When they refused, Sett barred the doors. Minutes later, the doors re-opened, and the Noxians emerged, badly maimed, with a message on their bloodied lips: the half-beast was the new boss.</p><p>With the promoters out of the picture, Sett took control of the pit he once fought in. Ionians, who had only recently been conditioned for war, flocked to the arena, paying to satisfy an urge they only now knew they possessed. Sett took full advantage of their newfound bloodlust, accumulating wealth and power beyond his wildest boyhood dreams, as he transformed the pit into the hub of an underground empire of gambling and vice.</p><p>The half-beast who reigned supreme in the pit now runs his illicit enterprises with the same iron fist. Any time someone challenges his authority, he personally reminds them where they stand. Every punch Sett throws is a blow to his old life of poverty and ostracism, and he intends to make sure that old life stays down.</p>",

Now, having climbed through the ranks of local combatants, Sett has muscled to the top, reigning over the pits he once fought in.",

He is Valoran&apos;s first fully functioning homicidal comic; he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The figure that has come to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from whence he came, and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief is that Shaco is not of Runeterra - that he is a thing from a dark and twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation of humanity&apos;s dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most plausible belief is that Shaco is an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic devices until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has proven himself to be a cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek him for questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such scuttlebutt might reassure the native inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable that such a malevolent figure is allowed to remain at large.</p><p>Whatever the truth of his history might be, Shaco is a terrifying, elusive figure most often seen where madness can openly reign.</p>",

Although born to one of the most revered families of northern Navori, it was his father\u2019s role as the Eye of Twilight that set his destiny in the Kinkou Order.</p><p>As the son of Great Master Kusho, he was immersed in the order\u2019s culture, and its core tenets were as familiar to him as the Ionian sunset. He knew the necessity of <i>Pruning the Tree</i>, the determination of <i>Coursing the Sun</i>, but above all, he learned the wisdom of <i>Watching the Stars</i>. He meditated and studied throughout his childhood, and was considered exemplary by all his teachers.</p><p>His closest friend, the only one who could match him in practice bouts, was the young acolyte Zed. They grew up as brothers, often confiding in each other their personal hopes and dreams. Shen could turn to Zed for a fresh perspective on any matter, and the two became known as the Kinkou\u2019s most promising students.</p><p>As their skills developed, Kusho brought them on dangerous missions, including a hunt for the Golden Demon plaguing the province of Zhyun. Their search took years, but Shen stayed committed even after uncovering countless gruesome murders. When they at last captured the \u201cdemon\u201d, it was revealed to be Khada Jhin, a mere stagehand from a traveling theater. Instead of execution, Great Master Kusho ordered the criminal imprisoned.</p><p>Though he and Zed both thought the killer deserved heavier punishment, Shen accepted his father\u2019s decision. He strived to emulate the Eye of Twilight\u2019s dispassion, and so found himself failing to console a bitter and resentful Zed.</p><p>Even when Noxian invaders threatened the peace of the First Lands, Shen reluctantly supported Kusho\u2019s inaction. But when Zed abandoned the Kinkou to join the fight, Shen stayed within the temple walls.</p><p>Many of the provinces were soon occupied by the enemy. Despite this, Shen focused on maintaining Ionia\u2019s spiritual harmony. So it was, when he was far from home, he felt a jolting imbalance within the Kinkou Order\u2014rushing back, he came upon the survivors of a bloody coup. From them, he learned Zed had raised acolytes of his own, and seized the temple.</p><p>Worst of all, Shen\u2019s father had been slain by the man he once saw as kin.</p><p>Repressing his anguish, he led the remnants of the Kinkou to safety in the mountains. Shen took up his father\u2019s spirit blade, as well as the title of Eye of Twilight. His role was not to seek vengeance, but to rebuild the order. Following the core tenets, he began to recruit and train others, hoping to restore its strength.</p><p>One acolyte in particular showed boundless potential. Shen taught the girl, Akali Jhomen Tethi, to master the arts of stealth and subterfuge. Her mother, Mayym, had stood alongside Kusho as the Fist of Shadow, and it seemed as though her daughter could follow the same path. Even so, Shen found himself forced to urge restraint whenever Akali would seek to strike back at their mortal foes.</p><p>When Noxus finally withdrew, many Ionians celebrated the victorious resistance. Others, like Shen, endured the consequences of war\u2014he persisted in his duty, while in private he wrestled with his hatred for Zed, and doubt in his own ability to lead. The years of conflict had taken a heavy toll on the First Lands, and Shen was uncertain whether the rebuilt Kinkou would ever be able to redress the balance.</p><p>Indeed, even as Akali became the new Fist of Shadow, he felt her beginning to drift away. In time, she openly denounced his teachings, and left the order.</p><p>Shen meditated, watching the stars, and understood that Akali would need to find her own way\u2026 and so would the Kinkou.</p><p>Sometimes, between unseen struggles in the spirit realm, Shen still contemplates the value of his beliefs. He has never let his emotions stop him from preserving tradition, but the question remains: how long can one man walk two worlds, before the acts of one destroy the other?<br></p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Though they are rare creatures now indeed, there exist a handful of places across Runeterra where the great elemental dragons still nest.</p><p>Long after the fall of the Shuriman empire, in the chambers beneath a lost volcano, the elder beast known as Yvva guarded her clutch of eggs. Beyond the depredations of rival drakes, dragon eggs were priceless almost beyond a mortal\u2019s comprehension, and so many were daring or foolish enough to try their luck. Yvva feasted upon the charred remains of a score or more would-be thieves over the years\u2026 before one succeeded in his attempt.</p><p>This upstart mage fled the mountains with the large egg hugged close to his chest, the jungle at his heels set ablaze by Yvva\u2019s fury. Against all odds, he reached the coast and left the dragon to slink back to her lair in defeat. She had lost one egg. She would not lose another.</p><p>The mage traveled north to Piltover\u2014but before he could find a buyer, the egg began to hatch. Whether it was the act of removing it from the nest, or the last moon of autumn giving way to winter, something had changed. It was no infant dragon that emerged, but an apparently humanoid baby girl with pale, violet skin, and the mage found he could not bear to abandon her. He raised the child as his own, naming her Shyvana after the dark legend of her brood-mother.</p><p>It became clear that Shyvana was no mortal. From an early age, she was able to shift her form into something monstrous, akin to the half-dragons of ancient myth. This made living among the common folk of Valoran difficult, to say the least. One thing was clear: Yvva retained some connection with her lost daughter, and it grew stronger over time. When her other offspring finally took flight, Yvva left her empty nest and soared far over the ocean in search of Shyvana.</p><p>The land was wracked by fierce border wars, but armies and villagers alike scattered at the great dragon\u2019s approach. Seeking refuge in a ruined farmhouse, Shyvana saw her adopted father engulfed in flames as Yvva swept low overhead\u2014the young woman dragged him into the nearby forest, but there was nothing more she could do. She buried him in a simple grave beneath a spreading oak, and set off alone.</p><p>After many weeks in hiding in the wilds, always on the move, Shyvana picked out the faint scent of blood among the trees. She found a wounded warrior, close to death, and knew this was someone she <i>could</i> save.</p><p>Without a thought for the beast that hunted her, she assumed her half-dragon form and carried the unconscious man far away, to an outpost on the borders of Demacia.</p><p>There, in the castle at Wrenwall, Shyvana discovered that this warrior was none other than Prince Jarvan\u2014the king\u2019s only son, and heir to the throne. Though the stationed soldiers regarded her violet skin and strange manners with some suspicion, she was made welcome. Demacians, it seemed, always looked out for one another, and her time in the town was the most peaceful she had ever known.</p><p>The peace was not to last. Shyvana sensed darkness on the wind. Yvva was coming.</p><p>The recovering prince, knowing that he had to marshal Wrenwall\u2019s garrison, brought the terrified locals inside the stronghold in preparation for the coming battle. Even so, Shyvana prepared to make her escape. Jarvan confronted her, and she admitted that the creature in pursuit of her was of her own blood. She could not allow innocent people to die for that.</p><p>Jarvan refused to let her go. Shyvana had saved his life, so it was only right that he fight at her side, now. Moved by his offer, she accepted.</p><p>As Yvva came into view, Demacian archers loosed volleys of arrows to keep her distracted. In retaliation, she bathed the battlements in flame, tearing at the stonework with her powerful talons and sending armored warriors tumbling from the parapet. It was then that Shyvana leapt forth, transforming in mid-air and bellowing a challenge to her brood-mother. In a sight seldom witnessed in Valoran since the Rune Wars, the two dragons clashed, tooth and claw, in the skies over Wrenwall.</p><p>And finally, bleeding from a dozen wounds, Shyvana grappled Yvva to the ground, and broke the creature\u2019s neck upon the flagstones.</p><p>The prince himself honored Shyvana\u2019s bravery, and promised that she would always have a place at his side, if she would return with him to his father\u2019s halls. With Yvva\u2019s skull as proof of their triumph, they set out for the Great City of Demacia together.</p><p>Shyvana has learned that King Jarvan III\u2019s realm is somewhat divided\u2014with the people\u2019s distrust of mages and magic putting them at odds with the noble ideals upon which it was founded. While she has found a measure of acceptance as one of the prince\u2019s most trusted guardians, she is left to wonder whether that would still be the case if her true nature were more widely known\u2026</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>The twisted, unfathomable madman known across Runeterra as Singed began his life as an ordinary man in Piltover. As a child, he displayed a prodigious intellect and a boundless sense of curiosity. The principles and interactions of the natural world fascinated him, eventually leading him to pursue a scholarship at the prestigious University of Piltover.</p><p>It did not take long for his brilliance to be recognized.</p><p>Singed\u2019s research into the natural sciences was impressive\u2014groundbreaking even\u2014but he found that Piltover\u2019s attention had been stolen away ever since the discovery of hextech, and the opportunities the hybrid of magic and technology presented. Singed found himself on the outside looking in, seeing magic as a crutch leaned upon by those who were either incapable of understanding how the world worked, or simply didn\u2019t care enough to find out. He became a vocal critic of what he saw as a new and ignorant fad within the university.</p><p>Singed instead delved into the chemical potential of alchemy, and despite the boon his intellect garnered for the field, his efforts earned him little more than the ridicule of his fellow academics. Before long, his funding had dried up, and he was forced out of the university, and out of Piltover. Singed had no choice but to begin a new life\u2014in Zaun.</p><p>In the undercity, life was cheap, and the demand for innovation high. Singed was quickly able to find work in the emergent chemtech industries, lending his skills and relentless drive for a variety of increasingly unscrupulous clients. His experiments, often of questionable ethicality, cast a wide net: augmenting humans, animals, and even fusions of the two, among countless other endeavours. Nonetheless, he pushed his new field forward at an incredibly rapid pace, but often at the expense of his own health. Understanding better than anyone the chemical needs of a living body, he engineered stimulants that could keep him alert and working for weeks at a time, before he would collapse, shivering and feeble, and sleep for days on end.</p><p>Singed\u2019s obsessive, tireless efforts as an alchymist meant he found no shortage of patrons and clients, eventually including even the warmasons of Noxus. The gossip was rampant across both Piltover and Zaun that the empire and their Grand General were on the verge of bankruptcy from paying Piltover\u2019s extortionate tithes for military passage to the campaigns in northern Shurima, and soon they might be looking elsewhere for new, less expensive conquests. So long as they paid his fees, Singed didn\u2019t care.</p><p>After years of smaller, off-and-on projects, Singed was approached by a Noxian military commander named Emystan, who contracted the alchymist to help her break the bitter stalemate of the war in Ionia. She needed a new kind of weapon from him, the like of which no one had ever seen before\u2026 and she could make him a wealthy man indeed.</p><p>Putting aside all other concerns, Singed poured all of his intellect, knowledge, and experience into the synthesis of this new weapon. The result of his efforts was an alchemical fire that was unstable, volatile, and utterly horrifying. When it was finally unleashed in Ionia against the enemies of Noxus, it burned hot enough to fracture stone, and tainted the earth around it with dense, metallic poisons so completely that almost nothing would grow there. Even Emystan\u2019s own allies were appalled, though not quite enough to name her and Singed as war criminals.</p><p>Now, without any restraint for capital, materials, or even subjects to experiment upon, Singed nonetheless feels the weight of years upon him. His most recent work has taken a decidedly more biological angle, and of a far more dramatic scope. A recent exercise in the melding of animal, man, and machine left his laboratories in ruins, his face held together with filthy bandages, and his subject freely prowling the streets of Zaun, yet Singed remains undeterred.</p><p>He has already mastered the destruction of flesh, and thus now has turned to the preservation and transformation of it\u2026 and perhaps even the possibility that life need not end with an inescapable death.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Singed is a Zaunite alchymist of unmatched intellect, who has devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge\u2014with no price, even his own sanity, too high to pay. Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.",

Greatly feared by friend and foe alike, he was the last of a proud warrior culture that had been part of Noxus since its founding. Sion had sworn oaths to his ancestors to never take a backward step in battle, and to die a proud warrior\u2019s death when his time came.</p><p>While not noted for his subtlety or strategic acumen, Sion\u2019s methods were ruthlessly effective, and he won many vicious triumphs for Noxus. The empire\u2019s might was at a peak not seen for hundreds of years, and so it took the generals of high command by surprise when a nation from the west first resisted, then began pushing back their steady advance. These <i>Demacians</i> drove the Noxian warbands eastward, harrying them back behind the walls of Hvardis. Sion, who had been campaigning in the Argent Mountains, now turned south, filled with fury.</p><p>He arrived at the city to find the Demacians on the horizon. They had no intention of besieging Hvardis\u2014having driven the Noxians from the lands neighboring their own, they were preparing to return home. Sion readied his troops, determined to punish these upstarts for their impudence. The Noxian commander at Hvardis, however, had already suffered several defeats to the enemy, and was content to hide behind the city walls and let them leave unscathed. </p><p>It had been Sion and his warriors who had paid the claim to the land now lost in blood; outraged, he hurled the commander from the city walls, and ordered the attack.</p><p>Sion tore straight through the Demacian lines, seeking out their leader\u2014King Jarvan the First. But while his own warband charged with him, fearless of death, those who had been cowering in Hvardis were weak. Their spirit broke, and they retreated back to the city, leaving Sion and his trusted few surrounded. One by one, they fell, but Sion ploughed on.</p><p>Alone, pierced by a dozen swords and a score of crossbow bolts, he finally reached Jarvan. The fight was brutal, and it was the Demacian who delivered the killing blow. Sion dropped his axe and, with a final burst of strength, tore the king\u2019s crown from his head with one hand, clamping the other around his throat. Jarvan\u2019s guards stabbed Sion again and again, but his grip did not loosen.</p><p>Only when the enemy king was slain did Sion allow death to claim him.</p><p>His body was recovered\u2014along with the Demacian king\u2019s crown, still in his grip\u2014and borne back to the Immortal Bastion in honor. Noxus mourned Sion\u2019s passing, and his corpse was interred within a towering monument constructed to honor him for all time.</p><p>Half a century passed before Sion\u2019s tomb was reopened.</p><p>Noxian dominance had waned in the years since Sion\u2019s death, and the ruling Grand General of the empire, Boram Darkwill, was willing to pay almost any price to restore its lost glory. Darkwill\u2019s allies, a mysterious cabal known as the Black Rose, reanimated the long-dead hero using forbidden magics, and presented him to the Grand General.</p><p>He could not refuse this gift, and so Sion returned to life, driven by unnatural bloodlust and utterly inured to pain.</p><p>He hurled himself like a living battering ram against the enemies of Noxus, destroying all he faced. More so than before his death, the victories Sion brought were costly. He was uncontrollable, killing friend and foe without remorse, and those forced to fight alongside him began to desert. Finally, Darkwill ordered Sion reinterred.</p><p>Hundreds of warriors died trying to restrain him before he was finally bound in chains and dragged back to the Immortal Bastion. Without slaughter, the blood magic that sustained him quickly engulfed his mind in an all-consuming rage. His roars finally fell silent as he was sealed in beneath his giant statue.</p><p>There he languished for many years, neither alive nor truly dead. When his tomb opened once more, it was to a very different empire. Darkwill was gone, overthrown by the general Jericho Swain\u2014but Sion cared little, roaring and pulling against his bindings in a frenzy that could only be sated in battle.</p><p>Chained within an iron cage, he returned to Hvardis, which had broken away from Noxian rule under Darkwill\u2019s reign; Sion was the new Grand General\u2019s punishment for their rebellion.</p><p>He butchered the defenders of Hvardis and leveled the city, laughing as he ripped its towers apart with his bare hands. Other regions that had abandoned Noxus soon bent the knee, fearing the undead juggernaut would be unleashed upon them next.</p><p>When harsh daylight floods his opening tomb, Sion now welcomes it\u2026 for with it comes the chance to shed his chains and sate his hunger for bloodshed, to briefly silence the screaming madness drowning out all thought of rest.</p><p>Sion remembers only fragments of his life, and less of the times since, but one truth has remained as stark as on the day of his death\u2014now, as then, the world trembles before him.</p>",
                "lore_short": "A brutal warlord from a bygone era, Sion was revered in Noxus for choking the life out of a Demacian king with his bare hands\u2014but, denied the peace of death, he was resurrected to serve his empire once more. His indiscriminate slaughter claims all who stand in his way, regardless of allegiance, proving he has retained little of his former humanity. With crude armor bolted onto his rotten flesh, Sion continues to charge into battle with reckless abandon, struggling to remember his true self between the swings of his mighty axe.",

                "lore_full": "<p>From an early age, Sivir learned firsthand the harsh lessons of Shuriman desert life. With her entire family slain by marauding Kthaons\u2014one of the Great Sai\u2019s most infamous raider tribes\u2014the young girl and other orphans like her could only hope to survive by stealing food from local markets, and delving into half-buried ancient ruins in search of trinkets to sell. They would brave cramped tunnels and forgotten crypts, hunting for anything of value, often scrapping viciously with one another over the best finds.</p>\n<p>Sivir would lead others into the depths, but could rarely hold on to what few treasures she managed to unearth. After being robbed by her supposed friend Mhyra, she swore she would never allow herself to be betrayed again, and in time she joined a group of mercenaries led by the renowned Iha Ziharo, serving as their guide and general lackey.</p>\n<p>Though her flourishing skill at arms eventually led her to become Ziharo\u2019s personal sergeant, Sivir noted that the domineering leader took the greatest share of gold and glory from every raid\u2026 even when it was Sivir\u2019s clever strategies that brought them their wealth. Rallying her fellow sellswords, Sivir decided to strike against Ziharo, and replace her as leader. Unwilling to kill her former mentor, though, Sivir left her alone in the desert with a hollow offer of good luck.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Sivir and her new followers earned a fearsome reputation. They accepted any task for good pay, including a commission from a Nashramae patriarch looking for a lost heirloom\u2014a blade known as \u201cthe Chalicar\u201d. Accompanied by his personal guards, Sivir searched for many months, until she finally pried a cross-shaped blade from the sarcophagus of some hero of the old Shuriman empire.</p>\n<p>This was a treasure indeed, crafted by cunning and magic in a long-forgotten age. Sivir marveled at it\u2014never had a weapon felt so natural in her grip. When the captain of the guard demanded they return it to their master, Sivir threw the blade in a curved arc, decapitating the captain and cutting down the three men behind him in an instant. She fought her way from the tomb, leaving only the dead in her wake.</p>\n<p>Sivir\u2019s reputation soon spread beyond the desert. Indeed, when Noxian expeditions began to move inland from the northern coast, she found herself in the employ of Cassiopeia, the youngest daughter of General Du Couteau, to help plunder Shurima\u2019s lost capital. As they traversed twisting catacombs, many of Sivir\u2019s mercenaries fell to ancient traps, but Cassiopeia refused to turn back.</p>\n<p>When they finally reached a great tomb door, surrounded by statued guardians and bas-reliefs depicting the mighty god-warriors of old, Sivir felt her blood stir. She was mesmerized by these beast-headed heroes, and their wars against the foul creatures of the underworld.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of Sivir\u2019s inattention, Cassiopeia thrust a dagger into the mercenary\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Sivir collapsed in agony, her blood soaking the sand. Using the Chalicar itself, Cassiopeia unlocked the tomb door, unknowingly triggering the sorcerous curse that had been placed upon it. On the verge of death, Sivir watched as a stone serpent came to life before her eyes, searing Cassiopeia's skin with venom. The last thing the sellsword heard before her senses dimmed were the roars of maddened gods, unleashed from the tomb to walk the earth once more\u2026</p>\n<p>But fate, it seemed, was not yet done with Sivir.</p>\n<p>Unknown to her, she carried the last trace of an ancient, royal bloodline in her veins. She awoke to find herself tended by none other than Azir\u2014the last ruler of the empire, who had been denied his rite of Ascension and passed into legend. Her spilled blood had reawakened his spirit after almost three thousand years, completing the ritual and imbuing him with all the celestial power of a god-emperor. There, in the Oasis of the Dawn, he used the healing waters of that sacred pool to miraculously <em>undo</em> Sivir\u2019s mortal wound.</p>\n<p>She had heard tales of Azir and his prophesied return, and always thought only fools could believe in such fantasy\u2026 and yet she could not deny what was unfolding before her very eyes.The earth split, and great plumes of dust whirled into the air as the ancient city of Shurima rose from its grave, crowned by an enormous golden disc that shone with the heavenly rays of the sun. Shaken to her very core, Sivir fled with the Chalicar on her back.</p>\n<p>While she would have liked nothing more than to return to her former life, she instead found herself caught up in the struggles of powers greater than most mortals could comprehend. At the city of Vekaura, she crossed paths with another Ascended being\u2014the freed magus Xerath, now seeking to end Azir\u2019s bloodline for good\u2014but with the help of the scholar Nasus and a young stoneweaver named Taliyah, Sivir survived once more.</p>\n<p>The time has now come when she must choose a path, either embracing the destiny she has been given, or forging her own amid the shifting sands of Shurima.</p>",

With ancient forces stirring the very bones of Shurima, Sivir now finds herself torn between conflicting destinies\u2026</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>All&nbsp;<zwsp>Ixtali grow up hearing the name Skarner, the ancient protector of Ixtal\u2014the brackern who shaped the earth itself and built the first arcologies. His visage is painted in reliefs and immortalized in the annals of Ixtal's history, a myth still honored and revered.</zwsp></p>\n<p>But deep beneath the cardinal arcology of Ixaocan is the chamber where Skarner dwells. There, he listens to the vibrations of the earth above him. Listens... and waits.</p>\n<p>Skarner's myth began millennia ago. Born to the brackern clan \u00d2\u0323pal-hin, he was a progeny of the legendary broodmother Nixal\u1eb9. While the other bracklings in his brood left the safety of Nixal\u1eb9's back, Skarner chose to linger, his unease and curiosity driving him to study her power and wisdom.</p>\n<p>Observation soon evolved into ingenuity. Unlike his broodmates, Skarner honed the brackern's innate control of earth and perfected the art of reading underground vibrational patterns, allowing him to sense and decipher far-away movements.</p>\n<p>When Skarner was older, it was through these vibrations that he detected a dramatic shift in the continent, marked by the arrival of settlers from the east. Clan \u00d2\u0323pal-hin did not trust these newcomers, but Skarner's curiosity could not be suppressed. He needed to know what made them tick.</p>\n<p>He surveyed these \"Ixtali\" people. They were born, they toiled, they died\u2014there one second, and gone the next. However, through his observations, Skarner saw that they used what limited time they had to build, create, and invent. Their existence fascinated him... until he discovered just how fragile they <em>truly </em>were.</p>\n<p>When a nearby rockslide threatened to destroy the burgeoning Ixtali settlement, Skarner, wanting to preserve the subjects of his observation, intervened. Emerging from the jungle, he towered over the people and used his physical strength and command of the earth to pulverize the rockslide before it could touch the village. As the dust cleared, the Ixtali gazed upon their savior in awestruck reverence and gratitude.</p>\n<p>Within Skarner, a protectiveness began to stir. These fragile beings could not survive without him.</p>\n<p>He no longer observed the Ixtali from afar, and as he became more involved with them, Skarner spent less time with his clan. The humans became his permanent project, and their nation, his new home.</p>\n<p>The relationship he formed with the early Ixtali was one of exchange: the Ixtali shared their culture and history, and Skarner used his earthen prowess to help build the cardinal arcology of Ixaocan where the planet's lines of power connected.</p>\n<p>But Skarner's greatest contribution was as a founding member of the civilization\u2019s ruling caste. Combining Ixtal's scientific mindset with the collectivist culture of the brackern, the Yun Tal\u2019s goal was to lead its people into a bright future.</p>\n<p>And so it was through Skarner's protection that Ixtal flourished.</p>\n<p>Outside of Ixtal, the Shuriman Empire extended its reach, and Skarner watched as Ascended stormed the continent. His belief in the resourcefulness of mortals was shattered as he saw the darker side of humanity: corruption, driven by a lust for power.</p>\n<p>Skarner could sense the building tension in Shurima. He was vocal about his distrust, but when the Shuriman Empire invited Ixtal to form an alliance, the Yun Tal eagerly accepted.</p>\n<p>With the Icathian rebellion, he was vindicated\u2014but at the cost of many lives. By the time the Shuriman Empire collapsed and Ixtal regained its independence, Skarner had nothing but disgust left for the world outside their jungle\u2014a wasteland of pain and suffering.</p>\n<p>A wasteland made even worse by the Rune Wars.</p>\n<p>Witnessing such destruction, Skarner finally convinced the Yun Tal to withdraw from the world, shielding their lands with magic and lies to hide themselves away.</p>\n<p>But his faith in the Yun Tal was shaken. Where they'd failed to keep the Ixtali safe, Skarner would not.</p>\n<p>Now knowing that only he could protect Ixtal, Skarner constructed himself an underground chamber below Ixaocan, designed to amplify the vibrational threads across the continent. Every thrum spoke of another threat to Ixtal's safety, but he could also hear the steady noise of Ixtal above him\u2014proof that, through his sovereignty, the city continued to survive.</p>\n<p>There, he listened... and waited.</p>\n<p>Deep beneath the dark earth, his paranoia festered until, over time, vigilance gave way to seclusion, and he ceased leaving his chamber altogether. To the Ixtali above ground, Skarner slowly faded from memory into myth, his presence known only by the Yun Tal who traveled underground to confer with him about Ixtal's future.</p>\n<p>Now, as new generations of elemental masters join the Yun Tal, discussions have begun about the possibility of rejoining the world once more. Skarner hears these whispers, which spur his paranoia, as he knows that opening the door will invite pain, suffering, and death like it did generations ago.</p>\n<p>The only one Skarner can trust is himself, and he'll do anything it takes to protect Ixtal and its people.</p>\n<p>Even if that means becoming the root of their destruction, himself.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>The ancient, colossal brackern Skarner is revered in Ixtal as one of the founding members of its ruling caste, the Yun Tal. Devoted to keeping his nation safe from the rest of the world, Skarner dwells in a chamber beneath Ixaocan where he can hear the vibrations of the earth and detect potential threats. As more members of the Yun Tal begin questioning Ixtal's self-isolation, Skarner grows increasingly paranoid and will do anything to keep Ixtal and its people safe\u2014no matter the cost.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Long before the lands that would become Camavor were named, dragons dwelt there.</p>\n<p>Once mortals arrived, conflict followed. The strife was only quelled when the first king of Camavor humbled himself before the dragon matriarch, bending the knee and pleading with her to lend her great strength to his armies, and all his dreams of empire. So it was that the dragon who would eventually be known as Grandmother Viper and the Camavoran ruler swore the oath of <em>Vol Visperi-Desinvein</em>, binding their lineages for generations to come.</p>\n<p>The dragons remained fiercely loyal to the throne and to those high houses that passed the trials and performed the sacred rites of the oath. In exchange, the dragons were kept satiated with livestock and showered with offerings. The gold, jewels, and precious artifacts they accumulated over the years garnered them a great respect\u2026 and those brazen enough to cross the dragons would pause at the thought of their own fortunes being reduced to molten slag and windblown ash.</p>\n<p>Long after Grandmother Viper passed into legend and her brood was already much diminished, the young king\u2014Viego Santiarul Molach Vol Kalah Heigaari\u2014called upon the imperial dragons to accompany him and the knightly orders to the Blessed Isles. The dragons refused, seeming to recognize his madness for what it was\u2026 though even remaining in Camavor with all their treasures could not spare the kingdom from the tragic repercussions of the Ruination. The handful that survived bore witness to endless neglect and conflict, roosting within the deteriorating palace where no monarch would ever reign again.<br></p>\n<p>Centuries would pass before another imperial dragon would hatch.</p>\n<p>As that hatchling grew, scarcity of game forced his mother to venture further and further to hunt. This left the nest vulnerable to far-roaming Noxian beastmasters, who stole the young dragon and set sail for home to collect their reward.</p>\n<p>However, shortly before arriving at their destination, the mother dragon discovered the ship\u2019s whereabouts and obliterated it with her fiery breath. In the chaos, the hatchling was swept away, borne by the current to a nearby island off mainland Noxus.</p>\n<p>Scared, alone, and hungry, the hatchling employed his mother\u2019s lessons to hunt small prey in this strange environment\u2014and on one such hunt, he stumbled across a human child called Marinos. The boy would go on to name his new friend \u201cSmolder,\u201d and as the young dragon\u2019s ability to communicate grew, their friendship flourished\u2026 but remained a secret. The boy feared that if anyone else were to discover Smolder, he\u2019d be taken to the mainland and sold to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p>As time passed, the boy grew into a man\u2014one with responsibilities that seldom allowed for the playtime Smolder had grown so fond of. And so, in an effort to amuse himself, Smolder decided he\u2019d learn to breathe fire like the dragons in Marinos\u2019 stories.</p>\n<p>After many attempts, instead of sneezing sparks as he\u2019d done countless times before, flames burst forth\u2026 and in his excitement over this new development, Smolder failed to notice the fire spreading until it had engulfed the forest canopy.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, louder than a hunting horn, louder than thunder, a roar unlike any other rang through the air as a massive dragon approached. Having been drawn by the rising smoke, Smolder\u2019s mother swept down to embrace her child lovingly, as if they never parted. Carried away from the growing inferno by the scruff of his neck, Smolder soared\u2014his first time experiencing the world as dragons should.</p>\n<p>Smolder now roosts with his mother on the cliffside where she\u2019d spent so long watching and waiting for signs he yet lived. Every night, she recounts the history of his kin, the meaning and responsibilities of imperial dragons, and how to hone his fledgling abilities.</p>\n<p>And one day, when he is ready, they will return together to their ancestral home to usher in a new golden age for Camavor.</p>",

Playful and eager to grow up, Smolder looks for any excuse to practice his burgeoning abilities. Though he\u2019s still a fledgling, his skills are nothing to sneeze at, easily setting fire to anything that burns.</p>",

But she was unusually thoughtful and attentive, and the other children tended to seek her out whenever they needed comfort, their playful smiles quickly restored.</p>\n<p>And Sona discovered other ways to express herself.</p>\n<p>Unlike her playmates, she had one possession when she was first found\u2014a curiously strung instrument, packed into a plain wooden case. None of the visiting musicians or teachers knew what it was\u2026 though that did not stop several of them from attempting to procure it for themselves, one way or another. Instead, Sona taught herself how to play it, and her simple, beautiful melodies moved even the most skeptical listener to tears of joy.</p>\n<p>However, dark times were approaching. The foreign empire of Noxus had begun landing troops in the northern provinces, and the monks decided to evacuate their young charges to safety before the invasion reached Galrin. After their caretakers struck a deal with a Demacian trader, Sona and a handful of her friends found themselves bundled onto one of the last ships to escape before the Noxian blockade of Ionia\u2019s western coast. She looked back in anguish, knowing that she would not be able to return for many years, if at all.</p>\n<p>After months at sea, they arrived in Demacia\u2014a strange, dour land where magic was widely distrusted. Their monks were called \u201cIlluminators\u201d, and they worshipped no gods or spirits, yet still placed great value on showing kindness to strangers and the needy.</p>\n<p>So it was that Sona was taken in by the Buvelle family. Lord Barrett and his wife, Lestara, were prominent supporters of the Illuminator order, and renowned patrons of the arts in the Great City. Sona became like a sister to their daughter, Kahina, and Lestara in particular grew very attached to her. The Demacian language was often difficult to learn, but the Buvelles developed a personalized sign language that enabled Sona to communicate easily with her new family, and their friends.</p>\n<p>Yet she yearned to express so much more. To show her appreciation to her adopted countrymen, she decided to use her gift to delight and soothe them, and returned to her music with renewed passion.</p>\n<p>Soon, word spread of her virtuoso talents. Her performances captivated audiences, bringing them from sorrow to bliss, from righteous martial pride to almost exquisite peace\u2026 and Lestara became intrigued by the mysterious instrument that made this possible.</p>\n<p>Delving deep into the libraries of the Illuminators, she came to believe it was one of the fabled <em>etwahls</em>\u2014wondrous artifacts dating back thousands of years before Demacia\u2019s founding, and now exceedingly rare in the world. If that were true, then this was an object of magic, and Sona\u2019s preternatural connection to it was a dangerous gift indeed. Lestara urged her to keep it secret, to avoid bringing unwanted attention from the Demacian mageseekers.</p>\n<p>Sona obeyed, though she wondered how something that brought people peace could be seen as a threat.</p>\n<p>Some years later, Lord Barrett Buvelle was slain fighting Noxus at the Gates of Mourning. When Kahina took up her father\u2019s blade and military commission, the heartbroken Lestara decided the time had come for Sona to return to Ionia, and the two of them withdrew from all courtly engagements to make the journey together.</p>\n<p>In the war\u2019s aftermath, a great \u201crestoration\u201d was underway across the First Lands, but the people were much changed by what they had endured, and Sona realized there was no longer any place for her there. Saying farewell to Ionia once again, she went back to Demacia with Lestara.</p>\n<p>Even so, her chosen homeland is not without its own problems. In the wake of King Jarvan III\u2019s assassination, the mageseekers have gained significant power, and many innocent citizens are persecuted for any supposed connection to magic.</p>\n<p>As a child of two wildly different cultures, Sona increasingly finds herself at odds with her family\u2019s political allegiances. With etwahl in hand, her melodies now serve not only to provide comfort, but also to defend what she knows is right and just.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Sona is a virtuoso of the stringed <em>etwahl</em>, speaking only through her graceful chords and vibrant arias. Her genteel manner has endeared her to the Demacian nobility, though some speculate her arresting melodies actually emanate magic\u2014a dangerous prospect in the kingdom. Silent to outsiders but understood easily enough by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also to strike down unsuspecting enemies.",

The guidance and fates that had been woven into the night sky often went unseen\u2014or worse, were misinterpreted by their simple mortal minds, leading to chaos, uncertainty, and suffering.</p><p>No longer able to merely watch, one celestial being chose to descend to the mortal realm, determined to untangle the knots in the tapestry of the world. This child of the stars took on a form of flesh and blood, and though the powerful magic coursing through her veins burned this new body from the inside out, she knew her suffering meant little if she could help to heal all that was broken and incomplete.</p><p>And so Soraka came to be, and set upon her journey to soothe the mortals she encountered.</p><p>Even so, she quickly learned the capacity for cruelty that the peoples of Runeterra possessed. Whether on the battlefields of inescapable conflicts, in the seedy underbellies of sprawling cities, or on the frontiers of the untamed wilderness beyond them, there seemed to be no end to the fighting, betrayal, and suffering Soraka witnessed. She watched, helpless, as mortals ignorantly broke the threads of destiny they could have woven together. Their lives were too short, she reasoned. They were simply unable to see the greater patterns, now lost.</p><p>But as Soraka lived among them, as one of them, trying to repair what little of the damage she could\u2026 something incredible and wholly unforeseen happened.</p><p>From the snarls and tangles and knots, the messy breaks in the great patterns, Soraka noticed a new, unintended design emerging\u2014intertwined, and of a staggering complexity.</p><p>Unintended and wild, the mortals were forging new and unknown futures for themselves. From the celestial realm above, it had seemed like pure chaos; but with her new perspective, and blessed by the stars to stand against the erosion of time, Soraka now beheld an almost perfect beauty. Just as mortals had the deepest capacity for cruelty, so too did they possess infinite potential for kindness, and inspiration to rival anything among the stars.</p><p>Soraka realized her place was not to repair or replicate the celestial pattern. While a part of her craved the fixed, comforting destinies of the stars, she knew in her heart that static fates could not contain the unbridled, dynamic potential of mortality.</p><p>And so her work took on renewed vigor, driven to unlock the untapped possibilities of all she met. Soraka sought now to inspire and guide rather than shepherd, to see what unblazed trails each mortal would discover for themselves in their brief, radiant moment.</p><p>Over the millennia, legends of the Starchild have filtered through all the lands of Runeterra. Some tribes of the Freljord still speak of a far wanderer, a horned healer who soothed the icy bite of the most brutal winters. In the depths beneath Zaun, rumors float of a lilac skinned medic who would purify weary lungs from the ravages of the alchemical Gray. In troubled Ionia, the oldest myths of the Vastayashai\u2019rei recall a seer who communed with the stars themselves, and called upon their light both to heal the wounded and scorch those who would do further harm to the First Lands.</p><p>Currently, Soraka calls the westernmost peaks of Targon her home. She watches over an isolated tribe of vastaya, teaching them her healing ways, and tending quietly to her own needs\u2014though what brings her so close to the great mountain, or how long she will stay, only Soraka knows.</p><p>Many times, she has watched entire civilizations dance close to the brink of destruction, and she has learned that she cannot save those who do not wish it, nor force them to see what they will not.</p><p>All the same, Soraka is determined never to stop trying.</p>",

The noble houses had played a key role in Boram Darkwill\u2019s rise to power, stoking rhetoric that their proud heritage was the nation\u2019s greatest strength.</p><p>However, many hungered for greater influence, plotting against Darkwill in a secret cabal united by nothing more than the symbol of a black rose. Uncovering their intrigue, Swain personally executed the most prominent conspirators. Among them were his own parents, whose whispers of a \u201cpale woman\u201d had first alerted him of the danger to Noxus, which he valued more than house or kin. </p><p>They sought a power, a shapeless voice cackling in the darkness of the Immortal Bastion. <i>Something like a raven\u2019s caw</i>\u2026</p><p>For exposing the cabal, Swain was granted a commission in the Noxian army, far from anything he had ever known. There, he learned firsthand that the empire was not strong because of Noxians, as he had believed, but because of the way it could unite <i>all</i> men in spite of their origins. On the front lines, a foreign slave could be the equal of a highborn noble. </p><p>But still, Swain found only darkness in the wake of each battle. <i>Clouds of carrion crows</i>\u2026</p><p>After securing the western borders, Swain\u2019s own reputation was secured in Shurima, where his forces raised countless <i>noxtoraa</i> above the desert sands. Yet, in time, it became clear that greed was the sole purpose driving the empire forward. Fighting wars on too many fronts, lusting over magical relics, the aging Boram Darkwill was clearly growing unhinged.</p><p>When Noxus invaded Ionia, Darkwill began to move even more brazenly, retasking entire warbands to scour the land for anything rumored to extend a mortal lifespan. With Swain\u2019s forces depleted, it became nearly impossible to engage the enemy. Finally, at the Battle of the Placidium, after luring the local militia into what should have been a trap, Swain\u2019s warhost was overrun. His veterans were routed, and Swain was gravely wounded, his knee shattered, Ionian blades cleaving through his left arm.</p><p>As he lay on the verge of death, a raven approached to feed, and Swain felt an old, familiar darkness press upon him again. But he would not let it take him. He <i>could</i> not. Staring into the the bird\u2019s eye, he saw reflections of the evil strangling the heart of Noxus. <i>A black rose. The pale woman... and her puppet emperor.</i> Swain realized that he had not defeated the hidden cabal, and they had betrayed him to what should have been his death, after seducing Darkwill, the man they failed to overthrow.</p><p>All this was glimpsed, not in the mind of a raven, but something <i>more</i>. The power his parents had been seeking, the demonic eyes blazing in the dark\u2026</p><p>Cast out of the military for his \u201cfailure,\u201d considered nothing more than a cripple, Swain set about uncovering what truly lay within the Immortal Bastion\u2014an ancient entity, preying upon the dying and consuming their secrets, as it had attempted to consume his own. Swain stared into that darkness, seeing what even <i>it</i> could not: a way to wield it.</p><p>Though his meticulous preparations took many years, Swain and his remaining allies seized control of Noxus in a single night. Physically restored by the demon, he crushed Darkwill in full view of his followers, leaving the throne shattered and empty. </p><p>Swain\u2019s vision for the future of Noxus is one of strength through unity. He has pulled back the warhosts from Darkwill\u2019s unwinnable campaigns and, with the establishment of the Trifarix, ensured that no individual can rule unopposed. He embraces any who will pledge themselves to the empire\u2014even the Black Rose, though he knows, in secret, they still plot against him.</p><p>Gathering knowledge as the demon did before him, Swain has foreseen far greater dangers lurking just beyond. However, many Noxians secretly wonder if the darkness they face will pale in comparison to the dark things Swain has done\u2026</p><p>The sacrifices are only beginning, for the good of Noxus.</p>",

Now, Swain commands from the front lines, marching against a coming darkness that only he can see\u2014in glimpses gathered by shadowy ravens from the corpses all around him.

                "lore_full": "<p>As a mage born to a poor Demacian family, Sylas of Dregbourne was perhaps doomed from the start. Despite their low social standing, his parents were firm believers in their country\u2019s ideals. So, when they discovered their son was \u201cafflicted\u201d with magical abilities, they convinced him to turn himself in to the kingdom\u2019s mageseekers.</p>\n<p>Noting the boy\u2019s curious ability to sense magic, they used Sylas to identify other mages living among the citizenry. For the first time in his life he felt he had a future, a life in service to his country, and he performed these duties faithfully. He was proud, but lonely\u2014forbidden from associating with anyone but his handlers.</p>\n<p>Through his work, Sylas began to notice that magic was far more prevalent than Demacia cared to admit. He could sense glimmers of hidden power even among the wealthy and prominent\u2026 some of whom were the most outspoken decriers of mages. But while the poor were punished for their afflictions, the elite seemed above the law, and this hypocrisy planted the first seeds of doubt in Sylas\u2019 mind.</p>\n<p>Those doubts finally bloomed in one deadly, fateful event, when Sylas and his handlers encountered a mage living in hiding in the countryside. After discovering it was only a young girl, Sylas took pity on her. When he tried to shield the child from the mageseekers, he accidentally brushed against her skin. The girl\u2019s magic rushed through Sylas\u2019s body\u2014but rather than killing him, it shot forth from his hands in raw, uncontrolled bursts. It was a talent he did not know he possessed, and it resulted in the deaths of three people, including his mageseeker mentor.</p>\n<p>Knowing he would be called a murderer, Sylas went on the run, and quickly gained notoriety as one of the most dangerous mages in Demacia. Indeed, when the mageseekers found him, they showed no mercy.</p>\n<p>Though he was still just a youth, Sylas was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>He languished in the darkest depths of the mageseeker compound, forced to wear heavy shackles of magic-dampening petricite. Robbed of his arcane sight, his heart turned as hard as the stone that bound him, and he dreamed of vengeance on all who had put him there.</p>\n<p>After fifteen wretched years, a young volunteer from the Illuminators named Luxanna began to visit him. Even with his shackles, Sylas recognized her as a singularly powerful mage, and over time the two forged an unusual and secretive bond. In exchange for Sylas\u2019 knowledge of the control of magic, Lux educated him about the world outside his cell, and brought him whatever books he desired.</p>\n<p>Eventually, through careful manipulation, he convinced the girl to smuggle a forbidden tome into his cell\u2014the original writings of the great sculptor Durand, detailing his work with petricite.</p>\n<p>The work revealed the secrets of the stone to Sylas. It was the foundation of Demacia\u2019s defenses against harmful sorcery, but he came to see that it did not suppress magic, but <em>absorb</em> it.</p>\n<p>And if the power was held <em>within</em> the petricite, Sylas wondered, could he release it\u2026?</p>\n<p>All he needed was a source of magic. A source like Lux.</p>\n<p>But she never visited Sylas again. Her family, the immensely powerful Crownguards, had learned of their contact, and were furious that Lux had broken the law to help this vile criminal. Without explanation, it was arranged for Sylas to be executed.</p>\n<p>On the scaffold, Lux pleaded for her friend\u2019s life, but her cries fell on deaf ears. As the headsman pushed past her to raise his sword, Sylas managed to touch Lux. As he had predicted, her power surged into the petricite shackles, ready for him to unleash\u2014and with that stolen magic, Sylas blasted his way free, sparing only the terrified young Crownguard.</p>\n<p>He left the mageseeker compound not as an outcast, but as a new, defiant symbol of the broken and persecuted in Demacia. While traveling the kingdom in secret, he amassed a following of exiled mages\u2026 However, perhaps he always knew that even their combined power would not be enough to succeed in toppling the throne.</p>\n<p>Which is why, with a band of his closest followers and several hardy oxen, Sylas eventually journeyed over the northern mountains to the frozen tundra of the Freljord.</p>\n<p>There he seeks new allies, and the great elemental magic of ancient legend, so that he might return to Demacia and demolish the oppressive system that has made him and his fellow mages suffer for so long.</p>",

As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served\u2026 and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day.",

                "lore_full": "<p>As a young child of Navori, Syndra was prone to distraction. She would often get lost in the magical beauty of a pond eclipsed in shadow, or a trail of sugarbeetles climbing the wall. Whenever her chores at home went unfinished, she was scolded harshly by her mother for her lack of focus. Syndra was even blamed when the milk soured, or when any other minor misfortunes befell the family.</p><p>Her older brother, Evard, teased her more than anyone. Syndra often fled to her favorite hiding spot\u2014the ghost-willow, a tree sacred to the people of her village. Alone, she would whisper to the tree for hours, seeking solace. Unbeknownst to her, one warm evening, Evard and his friends followed her in secret. They snickered at her childish tears. Her shame and rage grew as she tried to ignore their insults, until one of them threw a clump of dirt at her head.</p><p>Syndra could no longer control her emotions. All her anger erupted from deep within her, in the form of darkly shining magical orbs, heavy with the weight of her anguish.</p><p>This powerful ability had been dormant until now. It flared with volatile strength, the orbs like pearls of negativity that leached the spirit magic from the world around her, draining the ghost-willow of its life essence. Evard and his friends backed away in horror as the ancient tree twisted, its bark withering to a tarry black.</p><p>Deprived of the ghost-willow, the villagers grew concerned that their connection to the Spirit of Ionia had been severed, and Syndra\u2019s family was to blame. Forced to move on in search of a new home, all had become fearful of her magic.</p><p>After months of travel, they reached the coast and encountered a hermit-priest named Konigen. He spoke of his home on the island of Fae\u2019lor, where he taught those who wished to learn to control their wild magic, and Syndra\u2019s family could see no other option\u2014perhaps he could succeed where they had not. Young Syndra climbed the steps to a cliffside temple, crafted long ago from dark stone, and overlooking the sea. Though she missed her old life, she tried to embrace her teacher\u2019s wisdom, and put all her effort into tempering her emotions.</p><p>However, Syndra grew frustrated as, instead of gaining more control, over the years her magic seemed to weaken. Konigen now locked himself away each morning, meditating in solitude rather than teaching her anything new, and so she confronted him. His teeth gritted with exhaustion, he confessed that he was deliberately dampening her power, for her own safety. Such negativity had a strange, unpredictable effect on reality, and Syndra had grown far beyond his ability as a mentor.</p><p>She felt more betrayed than she ever had before. Konigen tried to calm her, which only fueled her anger\u2026 and in that moment, his focus was lost. </p><p>The foundations of the temple shook. The morning light seemed to pale. Syndra rose from the floor, as her frustrations surged within her. She snatched dark orbs from the air, and cast them <i>through</i> her mentor\u2019s body, forcing him to feel all of her bitter outrage as he died.</p><p>The ceiling gave way, rubble raining down, burying the sacred gardens in dust. Syndra turned her powers against what was left of the temple, sending shockwaves throughout Fae\u2019lor, and draining raw magic from the island itself. </p><p>Never had such negative energy been so concentrated in one place, and it was the Spirit of Ionia that swelled to counter it. The bedrock opened up beneath Syndra, dragging her down to a cavern deep underground\u2014roots pulled her into a pool of living water to suppress her powers, and trap her in a magical slumber.</p><p>Syndra dreamed for what seemed an eternity. Most of the world forgot she had ever existed.</p><p>War with the Noxian empire divided the people of Ionia, and Syndra was eventually awakened by those who had once stood guard over Fae\u2019lor. Some came to kill her, while others hoped she would aid them against Noxus, but she unleashed chaos upon them all. She refused to be a pawn in someone else\u2019s game. Ripping apart the walls of the fortress that had been built on top of her island prison, Syndra raised the greatest tower into the skies to carry her far away.</p><p>She would not be controlled. Not ever again.</p>",

They warned of a giant fish with a cavernous mouth, who would lure in the dissatisfied with the promise of more. One such story was that of a young man renowned for his honesty. Though born to the ways of a raftsman, he desired a life beyond the poor banks he knew so well, and the River King promised him an unforgettable experience if only he would tell one little lie. It seemed harmless enough, so the raftsman bent the truth in conversation with his own brother. That night the demon appeared, revealing a fork in the river the raftsman had never noticed before. He followed it to a camp of foreign folk who offered him food and drink, and fresh companionship. As dawn neared, and the raftsman was full and ready to return to his people, the demon appeared again, promising an even greater experience for another lie. His interested piqued, the man accepted the bargain, telling falsehoods to his hosts. The river parted again and he followed it to an evening of even greater luxury. This continued, night after night, until the once-honest raftsman\u2019s deceits came as easily as breathing.</p><p>When the river finally emptied into the sea, he found himself alone and lost\u2014there was no one left to lie to. So many dark choices, all of them his own, had left the raftsman with no way back home.</p><p>The brackish rivers of the mainland carried the tales of the River King to the Blue Flame Isles, where the creature gained a name as his legend grew\u2014Tahm Kench. In Bilgewater, fortunes are boom or bust, with as much wealth going out with the tide as comes in. Many a tavern yarn tells of ol\u2019 Tahm, a demon of the water with an unending appetite for games of chance, such that the loquacious beast became a symbol for many of the city\u2019s gambling dens and houses of sin.</p><p>Once the Sun Gates opened easy trade from Bilgewater to Piltover, tales of Tahm Kench became more common in the City of Progress and its underbelly, Zaun. There, children know Tahm as \u201cTwo-Coats,\u201d a fish so monstrously large that he wears two fine jackets stitched together. With a jaunty top hat and a smile wider than the Pilt itself, he drives the jealousies of young artificers. It is said he came one Progress Day to a struggling Piltovan inventor, and offered her an idea certain to make a wealthy clan take notice. All he asked in return was a single lock of her hair. The ambitious woman made the trade and, true enough, her work landed her a lucrative contract. But one invention would not satisfy, and Two-Coats wandered by, this time asking for all of her lovely braids. Not wishing to disappoint her new patrons, the inventor agreed\u2014and Two-Coats ate them up on the spot. Still the woman was unable to find the one great innovation that would make her name. The demon came again, offering a deal that would take the tip of one finger. The following week it was an ear. A year passed, and by then there was little left of the woman to give. Finally she called Two-Coats herself, begging him to make it all stop.</p><p>He laughed as he opened his jaws wide, telling her he would protect her from herself, and promptly swallowed her whole.</p><p>The River King. The Great Waddler. Old Yawn-Belly. Two-Coats.

                "lore_full": "<p>Taliyah is a nomadic mage from Shurima who weaves stone with energetic enthusiasm and raw determination. Torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility, she has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers. Compelled by rumors of the rise of a long-dead emperor, she returns to protect her tribe from dangers uncovered by Shurima\u2019s shifting sands. Some have mistaken her tender heart for weakness and paid the price for their error, for beneath Taliyah\u2019s youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth tremble.</p><p>Born in the rocky foothills bordering Icathia\u2019s corrupted shadow, Taliyah spent her childhood herding goats with her tribe of nomadic weavers. Where most outsiders see Shurima as a beige and barren waste, her family raised her to be a true daughter of the desert and to see beauty in the rich hues of the land. Taliyah was always fascinated by the stone beneath the dunes. When she was a toddler, she collected colorful rocks as her people followed the seasonal waters. As she grew older, the earth itself seemed drawn to her, arcing and twisting to follow her tracks through the sand.</p><p>After her sixth high summer, Taliyah wandered from the caravan in search of a lost goatling that had been placed in her charge. Determined not to disappoint her father\u2014the master shepherd and headman of the tribe\u2014she tracked the young animal into the night. She followed the hoofprints through a dry wash to a box canyon. The little beast had managed to get high up the rock wall, but could not get down.</p><p>The sandstone called to her, urging her to pull handholds from the sheer wall. Taliyah laid a tentative palm against the rock, determined to rescue the scared animal. The elemental power she felt was as urgent and overwhelming as a monsoon rain. As soon as she opened herself to the magic, it poured over her, the stone leaping to her fingertips, bringing both the canyon wall and the beast down on top of her.</p><p>The next morning, Taliyah\u2019s panicked father tracked the skittish bleats of the goatling. He fell to his knees when he found his daughter unconscious, covered loosely in a blanket of woven stone. Grief-stricken, he returned to the tribe with Taliyah.</p><p>Two days later, the girl awoke from fevered dreams in the tent of Babajan, the tribe\u2019s grandmother. Taliyah began to tell the wise woman and her concerned parents of her night in the canyon, of the rock that called to her. Babajan consoled the family, telling them that the patterns of rock were evidence the Great Weaver, the desert tribe\u2019s mythical protector, watched over the girl. In that moment, Taliyah saw her parents\u2019 deep worry and decided to conceal what really happened that night: that she\u2014not the Great Weaver\u2014had pulled at the desert stone.</p><p>When children in Taliyah\u2019s tribe were old enough, they performed a dance under the face of the full moon, the manifestation of the Great Weaver herself. The dance celebrated the children\u2019s innate talents and demonstrated the gifts they would bring to the tribe as adults. This was the start of their path to true learning, as those children then became apprenticed to their teachers.</p><p>Taliyah continued to hide her growing power, believing the secret she carried was a danger, not a blessing. She watched as her childhood playmates spun wool to keep the tribe warm on cold desert nights, demonstrated their skill with shears and dye, or wove patterns that told the stories of her people. On those nights, she would lie awake long after the coals had burned to ash, tormented by the power she felt stirring within.</p><p>The time finally came for Taliyah\u2019s dance beneath the full moon. While she had talent enough to be a capable shepherd like her father, or a pattern mistress like her mother, the young girl dreaded what her dance would truly reveal. As Taliyah took her place on the sand, the tools of her people\u2014the shepherd\u2019s crook, the spindle, and the loom\u2014surrounded her. She tried to concentrate on the task at hand, but it was the distant rocks, the layered colors of the land, that called to her. Taliyah closed her eyes and danced. Overwhelmed by the power flowing through her, she began to spin not thread, but the very earth beneath her feet.</p><p>Startled cries from Taliyah\u2019s tribe broke her out of her spell. An imposing braid of sharp rock reached up to the light of the moon. Taliyah looked at the shocked faces of the people who surrounded her. Her will over the stone broken, the earthen tapestry crashed down. Taliyah\u2019s mother ran to her only daughter, to protect her from the falling rock. When the dust finally settled, Taliyah saw the destruction she had woven, the alarm on the faces of her tribe. But it was the small cut across her mother\u2019s face that justified Taliyah\u2019s fear. Though the cut was minor, Taliyah knew in that moment that she was a threat to the people she loved most in this world. She ran into the night, so weighed down by despair that the ground trembled beneath her feet.</p><p>It was her father who found her again in the desert. As they sat in the light of the rising sun, Taliyah confessed her secret in choked sobs. In turn, he did the only thing a parent could do: He hugged his daughter tightly. He told her that she couldn\u2019t run from her power, that she must complete her dance and see where her path would take her. Turning her back on the Great Weaver\u2019s gift was the only danger that could truly break his and her mother\u2019s heart.</p><p>Taliyah returned with her father to the tribe. She entered the dancer\u2019s circle with her eyes open. This time, she wove a new ribbon of stone, each color and texture a memory of the people surrounding her.</p><p>When it was over, the tribe sat in awe. Taliyah waited nervously. It was time for one of her people to stand as her teacher and claim the student. What felt like eons stretched between Taliyah\u2019s hammering heartbeats. She heard gravel shift as her father stood. Next to him, her mother stood. Babajan and the dye mistress and the master spinner stood. In a moment, the whole tribe was on its feet. All of them would stand with the girl who could weave stone.</p><p>Taliyah looked at each of them. She knew that a power like hers had not been seen in generations, perhaps longer. They stood with her now, their love and trust surrounding her, but their worry was palpable. None among them heard the earth call as she did. As much as she loved these people, she did not see the one who could show her how to control the elemental magic that coursed within her. She knew that to stay with her tribe was to risk their lives. Though it pained all of them, Taliyah said farewell to her parents and her people, and set off alone into the world.</p><p>She journeyed west toward the distant peak of Targon, her natural connection to rock drawing her toward the mountain that brushed the stars. However, at the northern edge of Shurima, it was those who marched beneath the banner of Noxus who discovered her power first. In Noxus, magic like hers was celebrated, they told her; revered, even. They promised her a teacher.</p><p>The land had raised Taliyah to be trusting, so she was unprepared for the smooth promises and practiced smiles of Noxian dignitaries. Soon, the desert girl found herself on an unbending path, passing under the many Noxtoraa, the great iron gates that marked the Empire\u2019s claim over a conquered land.</p><p>The crush of people and the layers of politics within the capital city were claustrophobic to a girl from the open desert. Taliyah was paraded through the tiers of Noxian magical society. Many took an interest in her power, its potential, but it was a fallen captain who swore to take her to a wild place across the sea, a place where she could hone her abilities without fear, who made the most convincing case. She accepted the young officer\u2019s offer and crossed the sea to Ionia. However, it was made clear as their ship dropped anchor that she was intended as a glorified weapon for a man desperate to regain his place at the highest ranks of the Noxian navy. At dawn, the captain gave her a choice: Bury a sleeping people in their homes, or be discarded in the surf.</p><p>Taliyah looked across the bay. The cooking smoke had not yet risen from the village\u2019s sleeping hearths. This was not the lesson she had come so far to learn. Taliyah refused, and the captain threw her overboard to drown.</p><p>She escaped the tide and the fighting on the beach and found herself wandering, lost, in the wintry mountains of Ionia. It was there she finally discovered her teacher, a man whose blade harnessed the wind itself, someone who understood the elements and the need for balance. She trained with him for a time and began to find the control she had long sought.</p><p>While resting at an isolated inn, Taliyah heard that the Ascended Emperor of Shurima had returned to his desert kingdom. Rumor had it this emperor turned god sought to gather his people, the disparate tribes, back to him as slaves. Even with her training unfinished, there was no other choice; she knew she must return to her family to protect them. Sadly, she and her mentor parted ways.</p><p>Taliyah returned home to the sand-swept dunes of Shurima. As the punishing rays of the sun beat down on her, Taliyah pushed farther into the desert, determined to find her people. Hers was a will of stone, and she would do whatever was necessary to protect her family and her tribe from the danger that loomed on the horizon.</p>",

Instead, the clink of stolen gold and the security of a wall at his back are all the kinship he has ever craved. Kept alive only by his quick wits and deft thievery, Talon scraped out a living in the seedy underbelly of Noxus. His mastery of the blade quickly marked him as a threat, and Noxian guilds sent assassins to him with a demand: join their ranks or be killed. He left the bodies of his pursuers dumped in Noxus&apos; moat as his response.</p><p>The assassination attempts grew increasingly frequent until one assailant met Talon blade-for-blade in a match of strength. To his surprise, Talon was disarmed and facing down his executioner&apos;s sword when the assassin revealed himself to be General Du Couteau. The General offered Talon the choice between death at his hand, or life as an agent of the Noxian High Command. Talon chose life, on the condition that his service was to Du Couteau alone, for the only type of orders he could respect were from one he could not defeat.</p><p>Talon remained in the shadows, carrying out secret missions on Du Couteau&apos;s orders that took him from the frigid lands of the Freljord to the inner sanctums of Demacia itself. When the general vanished, Talon considered claiming his freedom, but he had gained immense respect for Du Couteau after years in his service.

He lent his creative talents, such as they were, to the stonemasons and craftsmen who raised monuments to the glory of the Winged Protector and the lofty ideals it embodied.</p><p>A work of art. A stranger\u2019s life. These were the things that made Demacia worth fighting for. Taric saw every one of them as beautiful, fragile, and worthy of saving.</p><p>Fortunately, his disarming manner and innate warmth allowed him to brush aside any criticism from his fellow soldiers or commanding officers. He rose modestly through the ranks, and even fought beside a young Garen Crownguard.</p><p>Ironically, it was Taric\u2019s steady rise that would bring about his eventual downfall\u2014at least as far as Demacia was concerned.</p><p>Elevated to the prestigious Dauntless Vanguard, he was suddenly held to a far higher standard of conduct. No more would he be allowed to roam the forests looking for glimpses of some rare animal, neglect combat drills to sit in a tavern and listen to a bard\u2019s simple ballad, or skip line inspections to ride out and observe the silver cloak of night settling across the hinterlands. Taric began to feel at odds with himself, and soon attracted attention as an insubordinate.</p><p>Garen urged him to shape up and do his duty. He could see Taric had the potential to become one of Valoran\u2019s greatest heroes\u2014and yet he seemed to be thumbing his nose at destiny as well as his country.</p><p>To keep him from demotion, Taric was seconded to serve the Sword-Captain of the Vanguard, though neither of them was particularly happy about it. However, when the older man was slain in battle along with the rest of his personal retinue, Taric was found to have abandoned his post\u2026 and rumor had it that he had been spotted wandering the cloisters of some forgotten ruined temple nearby.</p><p>Nothing more could be said. A dozen warriors were dead, and Taric faced the executioner\u2019s block for it.</p><p>However, seeking mercy for his friend, Garen intervened. As the Sword-Captain\u2019s successor, he sentenced Taric to endure \u201cthe Crown of Stone\u201d\u2014in accordance with Demacia\u2019s most ancient traditions, he would be sent to climb Mount Targon, a trial that few had ever survived.</p><p>Though the Crown of Stone usually allowed the dishonored to simply flee Demacia and start a new life in exile, Taric took the first ship heading south, and swore to <i>actually</i> atone for what he had done.</p><p>The climb nearly claimed him, body and soul, numerous times. But Taric pushed past the pain, the ghosts of his dead comrades, and other tests inflicted upon him by the mountain. As he approached the summit, he was beset by a wave of new visions of loss and destruction\u2026</p><p><i>He witnessed the great Alabaster Library set aflame\u2026 and still he dashed into the inferno to retrieve the heavenly poetries of Tung. He screamed in anguish as the Frostguard ran the last dreamstag into the Howling Abyss\u2026 and then leapt over the precipice himself in a desperate attempt to save it. At the gates of the Immortal Bastion, Taric slumped to his knees when he saw Garen\u2019s broken body swinging from a gibbet\u2026 before raising his shield, and charging headlong into the waiting hordes of Noxus.</i></p><p>When the visions finally faded, Taric found himself at the very pinnacle of the mountain, and he was not alone. Before him stood something wearing the shape of a man, though its almost crystalline features blazed with the light of the stars themselves, and its voice was a thousand whispers that cut through Taric like a blade.</p><p>It spoke truths he had somehow always known. It spoke of the mantle for which he had unwittingly been preparing his entire life, with every decision and deed that had brought him here, now, to Targon.</p><p>And he would stand as the Shield of Valoran in great wars yet to come.</p><p>Reborn as the Aspect of the Protector, gifted with power and purpose unimaginable to most mortals, Taric has gladly accepted this new calling\u2014as the steadfast guardian of an entire <i>world</i>.</p>",

In an age history has all but forgotten, he was a lowly warden of an order devoted to the gathering and protection of arcane knowledge. This order was established on the Blessed Isles, which were hidden and protected from the outside world by magical pale mists.</p><p>The masters of the order acknowledged Thresh\u2019s long years of service, and tasked him with the custodianship of certain hidden vaults beneath the city of Helia. It was there that a vast, secret collection of dangerous artifacts was kept under lock and key. Incredibly strong-willed and methodical, Thresh was well suited to such work\u2026 but even then, his penchant for cruelty had been noted by his brethren. While it had not yet manifested in <i>murderous</i> ways\u2014at least, none that could be proven\u2014he was shunned by many.</p><p>It became clear he had been given a job that kept him away from others, preventing him from gaining the recognition he felt he deserved. Solitary years in the darkness took their toll, and Thresh grew ever more bitter and jealous as he patrolled the long halls with his lantern-stave, and only his own resentful thoughts for company.</p><p>His moment of opportunity came when the armies of a mad king managed to pierce the veiling mists, and arrived unbidden upon the shores of the Blessed Isles.</p><p>Secretly, Thresh delighted in the slaughter that followed. The invading king was obsessed with resurrecting his dead queen\u2014and Thresh willingly led him to the fabled Waters of Life.</p><p>None but the most senior members of the order had ever been permitted to enter the hidden catacomb that housed the Waters. Now, with the king\u2019s greatest warriors at his back, Thresh laughed as the guardians of that sacred place were cut down before him. Finally, he believed, he would get what he had long deserved.</p><p>Only those who were there could say what <i>truly</i> occurred when the king lowered the lifeless corpse of his wife into the Waters, but the aftermath would shake the whole of Runeterra.</p><p>A catastrophic blastwave of dark energy surged outward, engulfing Helia and spreading rapidly across the rest of the Blessed Isles, and the white mist that had once protected them turned black and predatory. Every living thing in its path perished in an instant, and yet their spirits could not move on, caught in a horrifying new existence somewhere between life and death. Thresh himself was among the first to be claimed\u2026 but while others screamed in anguish at their fate, he reveled in it.</p><p>He arose from this cataclysm, this <i>Ruination</i>, as a spectral monstrosity, relishing the chance to torment others without fear of reprisal, and unfettered by the limits of mortality.</p><p>Over the decades and centuries that followed, his supernatural appearance slowly changed to match the malice and cruelty that had always festered in his heart. To his amusement, Thresh came to realize most other spirits trapped within the Black Mist retained only fragments of their former selves\u2014even the strongest of the foreign invaders, such as Hecarim or Ledros\u2014while his power continued to grow.</p><p>Driven by spite to prey upon those he perceives as lesser souls, Thresh\u2019s favorite victims have always been those who will suffer the most from his attentions. No matter how strong their resolve, resilience, or faith, he strives to break them as slowly as possible, by learning their fears and weaknesses, and toying with them to the very end. Only when their lives lie in tatters, their loved ones taken from them, their sense of purpose lost and their last glimmer of hope snuffed out, do Thresh\u2019s hooked chains finally drag them into his undying grasp.</p><p>Even so, death brings no merciful release, for he tears out the souls of all he kills\u2014imprisoning them within his accursed lantern, to be unwilling witnesses to his depredations for all eternity.</p><p>Only a single soul has ever escaped him.</p><p>Senna, one of the hated \u201cSentinels of Light\u201d, died a futile death after facing Thresh in some forgotten eldritch vault. Her distraught husband, Lucian, then pursued the cruel spirit for years, becoming singularly obsessed with the hunt, letting his grief and rage consume him almost entirely. To Thresh, it was delectable.</p><p>However, before he could finally claim Lucian\u2019s soul, a vengeful blow split Thresh\u2019s lantern open, and freed Senna from it.</p><p>Intrigued by the obvious strength of their mortal bond, he has decided to allow them this small and insignificant victory, knowing all too well that the game of light and shadow they all play is still far from over\u2026</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Like most yordles, Tristana was always fascinated by the world beyond Bandle City. She traveled far and wide, full of wonder and enthusiasm for the varied places, people, and creatures she encountered. Using the hidden pathways that only yordles know, she explored the length and breadth of the material realm, remaining mostly unseen.</p><p>She witnessed such breathtaking sights as ice trolls migrating across the floes of the far north beneath kaleidoscopic auroras. She marveled as warships blasted each other to pieces in naval battles that churned the seas. She watched, awestruck, as great armies marched with unity and precision\u2014incredibly strange concepts to a yordle!\u2014across the endless sands to the south.</p><p>But Tristana\u2019s carefree, wandering ways changed the day she witnessed the destruction of a bandlewood. These places are steeped in the magic of the gateways they grow around, giving yordles a safe haven from the world. Tristana, dozing in the dappled sunshine, was shaken awake as the trees around her began to burn and topple. A warband of armored marauders rampaged through the woodland with fire and axes, led by a sorcerer wreathed in dark energy.</p><p>Tristana hid in horror. The sorcerer focused his power upon the portal at the heart of the bandlewood, speaking one final utterance. Her ears still ringing with pain, Tristana watched the gateway collapse, never to be opened again. The ripples of that destruction were felt in Bandle City itself, causing great despair among the yordles.</p><p>Tristana had never experienced anything like the pain of this loss, or the guilt she felt for not acting. Never again would she allow such a terrible thing to happen. In that moment, she dedicated herself to become the guardian of all bandlewoods, and her fellow yordles.</p><p>Tristana had often marveled at how mortals protected the things that were dear to them. While she couldn\u2019t comprehend their reasons to guard shiny metals, or walls of stone, she respected their methods, and decided to emulate them. Other yordles watched with curiosity as she took to marching around the borders of Bandle City stern-faced, and watching out for danger. She started calling her food \u201crations\u201d, and set herself strict times for rest and relaxation.</p><p>But something was missing. In her travels, she had seen many powerful inventions, including the black powder cannons of Bilgewater. Inspired by them, she collected enough precious metal discs to commission a gun suited to her diminutive size.</p><p>With a wry smile, she named it Boomer.</p><p>Since then,Tristana has defended the bandlewoods from innumerable threats. In the jungles of the Serpent Isles, she intervened in a clash between the local Buhru people and treasure hunters from Valoran that was getting too close to a hidden portal, sending them all running for their lives after she leapt into their midst, Boomer roaring. And in the burning deserts at the edge of Shurima, she destroyed a Void-horror after it began consuming a secret bandlewood oasis, killing it with an explosive bomb down the gullet.</p><p>Tristana has become something of a legend in Bandle City, and recently, a number of yordles have started to imitate her, trying\u2014and mostly failing\u2014to copy her disciplined ways. Some have even had weapons mimicking Boomer constructed for them by the scrappy inventor Rumble, who is always seeking to win Tristana\u2019s approval. While Tristana finds this all rather embarrassing, she has come to the conclusion that if they are going to defend the pathways to Bandle City, they had better do it properly. As such, she has started training these new recruits, and they have adopted a new moniker\u2014the Bandle Gunners.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tristana can often be found out in the wilds on patrol by herself\u2014simultaneously protecting the bandlewoods and also getting away from her new, and rather annoying, trainees.</p>",
                "lore_short": "While many other yordles channel their energy into discovery, invention, or just plain mischief-making, Tristana was always inspired by the adventures of great warriors. She had heard much about Runeterra, its factions, and its wars, and believed her kind could become worthy of legend too. Setting foot in the world for the first time, she took up her trusty cannon Boomer, and now leaps into battle with steadfast courage and optimism.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Trolls are, for the most part, hulking and brutish creatures, found in many of Runeterra\u2019s least hospitable environments. Though not invulnerable, they are blessed with a hardy constitution and the ability to heal more quickly than other mortal races\u2014especially the feeble humans. This means they can endure extremes of climate and scarce resources merely by out-surviving their rivals, and this is the most likely reason some of the largest known tribes still call the mountains of the Freljord home.</p><p>Trundle was whelped in a filthy cave, along with a brood of fifteen brothers and sisters. Times were particularly hard, so that only seven of them grew strong enough to join the ranks of their chieftain\u2019s warband\u2026 and only three remained after their first winter of raiding.</p><p>As the warband feasted, the chieftain spoke of his intention to circle back and raid the same lands again. All would fear them. It would get easier every time.</p><p>Frowning, Trundle stood up, and said this plan was no good. The people they had crushed had nothing left for the tribe to take\u2014they should return next winter when the granaries were full again, and the livestock grown big enough to make more than a single mouthful.</p><p>Many of the other trolls did not like this at all. They ground their teeth and thumped the sides of their heads, trying to comprehend what Trundle was suggesting. Was he a coward? Had the cold got into his brain and turned it to slush? The chieftain beat Trundle with a rock, and threw him away down the mountainside. Fools had no place in his warband.</p><p>Trundle wandered far, for he knew he would not be welcome anywhere nearby. He avoided other troll tribes scattered across the tundra, and was careful to keep his distance from the feral yetis that roamed the highlands. By night, he gazed up at the stars and remembered all the stories he had been told as a pup\u2014legends of Grubgrack the Wise, and other ancient troll kings, who followed the old gods and were gifted powerful weapons as symbols of their right to rule the world.</p><p>Eventually, Trundle came to a great crack in the ground. While he was glad to be out of the wind, he soon found himself lost in a maze of twisted, howling canyons that seemed to sink deeper beneath the Freljord than the mountains rose above it.</p><p>And at the very bottom of that abyss, he met the Ice Witch.</p><p>She waited for him on a shimmering, frozen lake, surrounded by little human warriors skinned in furs and metal. Trundle was not daunted by any of this; but the Ice Witch wanted to know how he had found his way here, into the very heart of her domain, and how he was able to walk upon her lake.</p><p>Trundle looked down. The ice beneath his feet was darker than the night sky, far overhead. It made his brain want to squirm around inside his skull.</p><p>The Ice Witch told him he was special\u2014something called \u201cIceborn\u201d, which meant he should stay there with her. But Trundle did not want this, and told her how he had been cast out by the chieftain, and that he wanted to find a great weapon and become a troll king like Grubgrack and all the others. To his surprise, the Ice Witch agreed, and handed him a mighty club of ice called Boneshiver. With this, he could become king of all trolls, and form a great alliance with her human tribe.</p><p>He eagerly agreed, and began the long journey home.</p><p>When Trundle arrived, the chieftain laughed in his face\u2026 until Trundle bashed him over the head with Boneshiver. In an instant, the old troll was frozen solid by the club\u2019s icy magic, and a second blow shattered his body into tiny pieces.</p><p>Awed by Trundle\u2019s newfound strength, the rest of the warband listened to his tale of the Ice Witch, and the alliance she had promised. Trundle was smart. Trundle had been chosen to wield great power. Trundle would be their king.</p><p>And with Trundle leading the charge, the time of the trolls is surely coming.</p>",

Though they praised all the Freljord\u2019s old gods, as well as the Cult of the Three, they prayed most often to a spirit-deity known to ravage the tundra\u2014a hearty and unkillable tusklord. Since the raw materials required for armor were scarce, the clan instead put its resources toward the forging of great blades, inspired by their god\u2019s ivory canines.</p><p>The stamina and dueling prowess of Tryndamere\u2019s people became legendary. They were able to fend off other raiding tribes, slay the great beasts of the mountains, and repel Noxians encroaching to the south. Tryndamere himself grew to be a brash and formidable warrior, but it wasn\u2019t until a particularly cruel midwinter night that his strength was truly tested. An unusual storm swept in from the east, bringing with it an icy darkness, and a towering, horned figure silhouetted against the full moon.</p><p>Some in the clan knelt, believing that their boar-god stood among them. This creature dripped with ancient magic, true enough, but he was not of the Freljord\u2026 and those that knelt were the first to die.</p><p>Tryndamere looked on in horror. He could feel unhinged brutality rising in his heart at the sight of the invader\u2019s cruel, living sword. Whether taken by bloodlust or some other madness, Tryndamere raised his own blade, and let out a defiant roar.</p><p>The dark figure swatted him aside like an insect.</p><p>Tryndamere lay surrounded by the dead, in snow soaked almost black with blood. He drew what he thought would be his last breaths as the creature approached and spoke. Tryndamere tried to hold onto the strange, archaic words, but as his life force slipped away, it was the thing\u2019s laughter that burned itself into the young warrior\u2019s memory.</p><p>For Tryndamere did not die that night. He was revived by a rage unlike anything he had ever experienced. He looked to the eastern horizon, intent on avenging not only the destruction of his clan, but the desecration of his own martial pride.</p><p>However, retribution was not what the steppes offered him. There were survivors, and they would not be long for this world if Tryndamere could not find others to shelter them. There were Noxians to the south, Frostguard to the north, and the dark figure had come from the east. To the west, it was said that some tribes were gathering before the supposed reincarnation of Avarosa\u2014once, he might have dismissed such fanciful rumors, but now he knew this was his only recourse.</p><p>Tryndamere and the remnants of his people arrived in the valley as little more than beggars. The young warrior was determined to show his clan\u2019s worth, and win them the Avarosan leader\u2019s protection so that he could return to thoughts of revenge. Brandishing his tusked sword, he did what came naturally, and challenged others to duels. Holding the image of the dark figure and its echoing laughter in his mind, Tryndamere quickly bested anyone who stepped forward.</p><p>His singular fury was deeply unsettling to the Avarosans. The northern warriors, too, noted his rapid healing between bouts\u2014unlike the Iceborn that walked among them, the more Tryndamere gave in to his rage, the more quickly his body healed. Many suspected he and his clan practiced strange and unnatural magics, and so Tryndamere\u2019s plan to prove his worth was now endangering the wider acceptance of his people.</p><p>But not all of the Avarosans had turned against him. Their warmother, Ashe, was looking to strengthen her position with a political marriage\u2026 to someone who could face down the endless challengers for her hand, and to her rule. Seeing an opportunity in the handsome barbarian, she pledged to take in his clan as Avarosans, if Tryndamere became her first and only bloodsworn.</p><p>As he spent more time in Ashe\u2019s company, he began to believe what others had whispered\u2014that she was indeed the divine reincarnation of Avarosa herself. His rage found temperance in her thoughtful leadership, and a genuine affection grew between them.</p><p>Even so, serving as Ashe\u2019s champion, Tryndamere now looks to an uncertain future. The barbarian king can see war brewing all too clearly on the Freljord\u2019s horizon, yet he still thirsts for his own, personal vengeance, and begins to wonder if his predestined fate might not be at his queen\u2019s side after all\u2026</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>Fueled by unbridled fury and rage, Tryndamere once carved his way through the Freljord, openly challenging the greatest warriors of the north to prepare himself for even darker days ahead. The wrathful barbarian has long sought revenge for the annihilation of his clan, but more recently he has found companionship with Ashe, forging an alliance of marriage with the Avarosan warmother. His almost inhuman strength and fortitude are legendary, and have delivered him and his new allies countless victories against the greatest of odds.</p>",

Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange traditions, his people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders would shrug, and say this was just the way of the world\u2026 but the obvious prejudice always stuck in Tobias\u2019 craw.</p>\n<p>He found his true calling in the gambling tents, between games of chance and skill like Mortwheel and Stabberscotch, when he first picked up a deck of playing cards. Many years earlier, his superstitious grandfather had shown him how to read omens in the shuffle and cut, while his aunt had later taught him how to read all an opponent\u2019s tells. Between the two, Tobias took to the high-stakes game of Krakenhand like an old master. He could almost <em>feel</em> each card\u2019s place in the deck, and follow their movements through each successive hand. He was often accused of cheating, but it was difficult for anyone to explain exactly how.</p>\n<p>Finally, one night, a group of men who\u2019d lost their fortunes to young Tobias returned in the dead of night to settle the score. They came bearing cudgels and, emboldened by cheap rotgut, went from tent to tent in their search for him, beating down any of the river folk who got in their way. Fearing for his life, Tobias turned and fled into the darkness.</p>\n<p>When dawn came, the lad sheepishly crept back to find his people breaking down the camp. No one would look him in the eye. He had thought only of himself, and left others to face the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p>Though he begged and pleaded with them all, Tobias was exiled for what he had done. With his whole world falling apart around him, he watched helplessly as the barques left, leaving him alone on the riverbank with nothing but his grandfather\u2019s worn deck of cards clutched in his hands.</p>\n<p>He grew to manhood as a drifter, trawling the gambling halls of every settlement he came to, using his preternatural skill to earn enough coin to survive. That Tobias was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus\u2014though he was always careful to let his marks win at least a few hands, here and there.</p>\n<p>Across one table, he met a deplorable fellow named Malcolm Graves.</p>\n<p>Each recognizing a kindred soul, Tobias and Graves quickly joined forces, and the two of them spent years running various\u2026 <em>dubious endeavors</em> across the northeastern coastal towns, and beyond. With every con, swindle, and heist, Tobias felt the pull of the cards growing stronger, and he knew it was more than mere gambler\u2019s luck that guided him. His people had always waved away concerns over primitive magic and \u201ccartomancy\u201d, but now Tobias began to seek out ever more dangerous means to bend the cards to his will.</p>\n<p>That search ended badly when a particularly daring heist went wrong. The exact details of that night remain shrouded in mystery, for neither of them likes to speak of it\u2014but Graves was taken alive, while Tobias and their other accomplices ran free.</p>\n<p>Though he tried to break Graves out, he failed. Instead, seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the river\u2019s waters, and took another: Twisted Fate.</p>\n<p>After that, Twisted Fate continued to ply his criminal trade in the high parlors and low dens of every city he visited, though without his partner to help him, he tended to find himself cornered far more often. Indeed, he was imprisoned with great fanfare too many times to count, yet no cell ever seemed able to hold him for long; Twisted Fate was always gone with morning\u2019s light, leaving only a mocking calling card to confirm he had ever been there at all.</p>\n<p>In the port of Bilgewater, Twisted Fate and Graves finally had their day of reckoning. They were forced to put aside their differences after being caught up in a power struggle between the ship captains who ran the place\u2014but following the death of the reaver king Gangplank, the pair managed a swift reconciliation before shoving off and making for distant Piltover.</p>\n<p>All in all, Twisted Fate is glad to have his old friend back, even if it might take another job or two\u2014<em>or ten</em>\u2014to restore their once easy partnership.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Whenever the moon rises into a wintery sky, round and red as blood, the spirit walkers of the Freljord know that another of their kind has been born into the world. One attuned to the wilds and the land, one who walks within and beside the spirit that best matches the shape of their heart. On the night of Udyr\u2019s birth, there was nothing in the crimson moon that suggested anything different than that.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing that would suggest Udyr was already the most powerful walker to ever live.</p>\n\n<p>Every being has spirit, whether person or beast, plant or animal, dead or alive or deathless. But unlike his brethren, Udyr\u2019s power of spiritual connection was not limited to one type of spirit\u2014he could hear them all. The needs and wants of everything around him constantly flooded his mind, making it impossible to hear anything above their roar.</p>\n\n<p>His parents did not know how to help him. Their warmother sent for other spirit walkers to train the boy, but each said the same thing: spirit walker training focused on opening oneself up, not closing oneself off.</p>\n\n<p>The first time Udyr tapped into his powers with purpose was the night the Frostguard came for him. Young Udyr, terrified, hid in the forest. He did not expect to feel the life ripped from... everyone. His entire tribe, slaughtered in an instant. Howling with sadness and rage, Udyr took power from the spirits of the forest. With a swipe of his claws and a beating of his wings, he brought the mountain down on the Frostguard. Alone, grieving, and overwhelmed, Udyr wandered the wastes for years, doing what he had to in order to survive.</p>\n\n<p>He did not interact with humans again until he landed the killing blow on a wildclaw that was troubling a Winter\u2019s Claw hunting party. Impressed, they brought Udyr back to camp. Warmother Hejian sent him to be trained in the ways of war alongside her daughter Kalkia. The wild boy showed the lonely daughter how to live in the wild, and she showed him how to live among people. Soon, the Winter\u2019s Claw began to almost feel like a home.</p>\n\n<p>But that changed when a pack of starved and diseased rimefang wolves skulked close to the camp. Udyr lost himself in the fog of the pack\u2019s madness and hunger, attacking and nearly killing a child. It took Kalkia and her mother\u2019s True Ice to stop Udyr. After the wolves had all been slain, Hejian banished Udyr from the Winter\u2019s Claw.</p>\n\n<p>Udyr returned to the mountains, far from those he could hurt. Kalkia would visit whenever she could get away until she was eventually called upon to lead her tribe. She joyfully lifted Udyr\u2019s banishment, but he refused to return. He still had no control over the spirits whose wants and needs howled inside his mind, but swore he would always be there to protect Kalkia and the people she loved. That was the last time they saw one another.</p>\n\n<p>Everything changed when a foreign monk sought him out, saying he had come to train with the spirit walkers so that he may learn how to subdue the dragon spirit that burned within him. Udyr refused, but the monk challenged Udyr for the right to train with him. They fought to their limits, but in the end, neither won.</p>\n\n<p>The monk introduced himself as Lee Sin, and said that this battle had shown him they <em>both</em> had much to learn. He invited Udyr to train in his homeland of Ionia. With nothing left to tie him to the Freljord, Udyr agreed.</p>\n\n<p>The two men grew close during their journey, taking time each day to spar together and to speak of the spirits, but when they finally arrived at Hirana Monastery, they found it besieged by Noxian invaders. Calling upon the spirits of Ionia, Udyr leapt into the fray.</p>\n\n<p>After their victory, the two men asked the abbott for guidance and how to learn control. The abbott told them that self-mastery had no guaranteed end, but agreed to train them both.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time, Udyr\u2019s mind was quiet enough for him to hear his own thoughts. He and Lee trained together to master the spirits within and beside them. With new knowledge and understanding, Udyr was able to help Lee and his dragon find balance with one another. And through this endeavor, Udyr came to understand that harmony and interdependence created a state of balance in Ionia. In contrast, balance in the Freljord was based on a sense of struggle and conflict\u2014of growth and change\u2014where the fight to survive against an uncaring and dangerous environment lived deep in the soul of every Freljordian.</p>\n\n<p>After several years, Udyr\u2019s powers plateaued. He was faced with the choice to stay and train in Ionia, or return to the struggle of his homeland where he could continue his growth. In the end, the choice was obvious.</p>\n\n<p>Lee gave Udyr one of his blindfolds to keep with him\u2014a reminder of his commitment to self-mastery\u2014and asked for a promise. That, once Udyr had achieved what he was looking for in the Freljord, he would return the blindfold to Lee in person. Udyr wrapped the blindfold around his hand before setting off across the world once again to take up the mantle of spirit walker.</p>\n\n<p>A new conflict between an Avarosan and Winter\u2019s Claw warmother greeted Udyr upon his return to the Freljord. The Avarosan wanted to unite the people of the Freljord under a single banner, putting an end to their struggles. Udyr understood that such an action would harm the spirit of the land, and so he decided to offer counsel to the other side\u2014the Winter\u2019s Claw. It was Kalkia\u2019s headstrong daughter Sejuani who received him, and he could feel her need for guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The young woman accepted Udyr\u2019s help, but Sejuani\u2019s trust was hard-won, for she had grown up hearing tales of the spirit walker and his bloodlust. Udyr came to appreciate Sejuani\u2019s drive and cleverness, though her ruthlessness worried him. Sejuani saw wisdom and a warrior\u2019s heart in Udyr, but his frequent absences grated her nerves. In time, they came to view one another like family\u2014a surrogate oathfather and daughter\u2014though they would never say it aloud.</p>\n\n<p>Before long, the other spirit walkers summoned Udyr down to the south. But fate intervened when he met a strange old woman in an enormous coat. She asked for his help with several impossible tasks that he inevitably failed. Entertained by his attempts, she rewarded his efforts with bread so salty that he choked, and water so cold that his veins turned to ice. The old woman laughed at his reaction and shrugged off her coat, and the spiritual power hit Udyr like an avalanche. He passed out, and woke alone. But he could feel something had changed within him\u2014a new power had awakened. He didn't realize it, but the Seal Sister, in one of her many disguises, had tested Udyr and given him her blessing.</p>\n<p>Still unnerved by this odd encounter, Udyr joined his brethren in the south and listened as they told him of a strange spiritual shift they had each felt. They feared the Freljord was dying\u2014the spirits of the land itself crumbling from within. Udyr believed that it was the Avarosans, in their efforts to unite the Freljord, that was causing this pain. He told the other spirit walkers as much, and asked them to fight against the Avarosan advance alongside the Winter's Claw. Many were skeptical, but others, afraid that Udyr might be right, agreed.</p>\n<p>With his new spiritual power flowing within him, Udyr raced back to the Winter\u2019s Claw to help end this existential threat to the Freljord once and for all.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>The most powerful spirit walker alive, Udyr communes with all the spirits of the Freljord, whether by empathically understanding their needs, or by channeling and transforming their ethereal energy into his own primal fighting style. He seeks balance within, so that his mind does not get lost amidst others, but he also seeks balance without\u2014for the Freljord's mystical landscape can only thrive with the growth that comes from conflict and struggle, and Udyr knows that sacrifices must be made to keep peaceful stagnance at bay.</p>",

His pride swelled as the bodies piled ever higher behind him, and his intimidating presence kept countless warbands in line.</p><p>Even so, a single word was all it took to seal his fate. Sent to distant Zaun to eliminate a supposed conspiracy against the ruler of Noxus, Urgot realized too late the mission was a setup, removing him from the capital even as the usurper Swain seized control of it. Surrounded by agents of the chem-barons, and enraged that everything he believed was a lie, Urgot was dragged down into the chemtech mines beneath Zaun. He was defeated. He was <i>enslaved</i>. He was not worthy after all. He endured the mine\u2019s hellish conditions in grim silence, waiting for death.</p><p>In the Dredge, death came in many forms\u2026</p><p>The mine\u2019s warden, Baron Voss, would sometimes offer freedom in return for a prisoner\u2019s tortured confession\u2014granting it with the edge of her blade. From the screams that echoed through the tunnels, Urgot learned about the wonders of Zaun. There was something special about the city, something marvelous and evident even in the secrets that spilled from slit throats. Urgot didn\u2019t know what it was until he was finally brought before Voss, fearing that she would break him.</p><p>But as the baron\u2019s blade cut into his flesh, Urgot realized that his body was already wracked with agony, far beyond anything Voss could inflict. The Dredge had made him stronger than he\u2019d ever been as a headsman.</p><p><i>Pain</i> was Zaun\u2019s secret. His laughter drove Voss back to the surface, and a reign of anarchy began in the depths.</p><p>Seizing control of the prison, Urgot reveled in new trials of survival. He found the parts of his body that were weakest, and replaced them with scavenged machinery, technology created by those who would die without it\u2014necessity being the mother of pain.</p><p>The guards could no longer enter the areas Urgot had carved out of Voss\u2019 grasp. The prisoners themselves were more afraid of their new master than they were of her. Many even grew to hold a fanatical respect for Urgot, as they were forced to hear his feverish sermons on the nature of power, his grip tightening around the necks of those who would not listen.</p><p>Only when a Noxian agent arrived in the Dredge was Urgot finally forced to confront his own past. Though the spy recognized him and sought his aid in escaping, Urgot beat him mercilessly, and hurled his broken body into the darkness.</p><p>It was not strength that ruled Noxus, Urgot now realized, but men\u2026 and men were weak. There should be no rulers, no lies, nothing to interfere with the pure chaos of survival. Starting a riot that ignited a chemtech vein within the mine, Urgot shook the city above, and cracked the prison open in an explosion that rivaled the birth of Zaun itself. Many prisoners died, with thousands fleeing into the Sump\u2014but the worthy, as ever, survived.</p><p>From that day, Urgot\u2019s reign of terror only grew. A hideous fusion of industrial machinery and Noxian brutality, he slaughtered chem-barons and their lackeys one by one, gathering a following among Zaun\u2019s downtrodden masses. He was said to be a new savior, one who would lift the boot of the oppressor from the neck of every common Zaunite.</p><p>However, his actions did not make such distinctions, as Urgot tested the worthiness of the meek and the powerful alike. To any who found themselves spared in his deadly trials, his message was clear: he was not there to lead, but to <i>survive</i>. If others were worthy, they would survive, too.</p><p>When Urgot finally struck at representatives of the Piltovan merchant clans, the Wardens were forced to intervene, hauling him in chains to a fortified prison cell\u2014though this merely seemed to confirm \u201cthe Dreadnought\u201d as a legend among the gangers, the sump-snipes, and the forgotten.</p><p>For Piltover is not the first to shackle Urgot, and one must wonder if any cage can <i>ever</i> hope to hold him for long\u2026</p>",
                "lore_short": "Once a powerful Noxian headsman, Urgot was betrayed by the empire for which he had killed so many. Bound in iron chains, he was forced to learn the true meaning of strength in the Dredge\u2014a prison mine deep beneath Zaun. Emerging in a disaster that spread chaos throughout the city, he now casts an imposing shadow over its criminal underworld. Raising his victims on the very chains that once enslaved him, he will purge his new home of the unworthy, making it a crucible of pain.",

A skilled archer of the ancient Shuriman empire, he was appointed as a temple warden in the eastern states, and he held this duty sacred above all else.</p><p>During the earliest stages of the war with Icathia, even though it lay far from that cursed place, Varus\u2019 homeland was attacked. While other wardens abandoned their posts to join the defense of the outlying villages, he alone remained, screaming in anguish with every arrow he loosed\u2014for he had chosen to uphold his oaths rather than return home to protect his own family.</p><p>Emissaries from the Ascended Host found him kneeling in solemn meditation amid the corpses of his foes. It was said that his cold gaze unsettled even the god-warriors themselves, and yet, in recognition of his noble sacrifice, Varus was offered a place in their ranks.</p><p>As one of the great Ascended, he was utterly consumed by his pursuit of vengeance against the Icathians, and the voidling horrors they had unleashed. It is likely that Varus did not even fully comprehend Shurima\u2019s ultimate victory in that war, so twisted had his mind become\u2014nor the empire\u2019s fall centuries later. Atrocity after atrocity blurred together, leaving him as a withdrawn, callous killer, reshaped and sent into battle countless times by his degenerate brethren.</p><p>Their name became feared throughout the known world.</p><p>The <i>darkin.</i></p><p>Warring among themselves, they destroyed any other who stood against them. With his crystalline bow, Varus assassinated enemy commanders and champions, helping the darkin defeat entire mortal armies with ever greater ease.</p><p>Eventually, Varus was cornered by vastayan moon-stalkers and human mages in service of a golden-armored warrior queen of Valoran. They bound him within his bow, leaving him to howl in impotent rage. By then, the raw, corrupting influence of the darkin was known, and yet still the queen chose to wield the deadly weapon in the final days of the war, gladly sacrificing herself for a greater victory.</p><p>In the months that followed, the queen carried Varus to the First Lands\u2014those that would later be known as Ionia. Now made monstrous by the bow\u2019s power, her last act was to command her followers to bury her alive in a lightless well, sunk deep beneath a mountain temple overlooking the village of Pallas.</p><p>And there Varus was imprisoned, both by the natural magic of Ionia, and the ritual ministrations of the temple guardians.</p><p>The bow remained hidden for centuries, unknown, untouched, and all but forgotten, until Noxian invaders attacked the First Lands. Two beast hunters\u2014Valmar and his heartlight, Kai\u2014fought against the first wave at the Temple of Pallas. Though their courage was great and they drove off the attackers, Kai was mortally wounded, and a grief-stricken Val carried him inside, believing the well\u2019s forbidden magic could restore him.</p><p>But the temple held only damnation, and both hunters were consumed by the unleashed power of the darkin within it. The very matter of their bodies was unraveled and bound together again to craft a new body, a body fit to free Varus from his imprisonment. What emerged from the well was a gestalt creature, pale and inhumanly beautiful, part human and part darkin. After more than a thousand years, Varus was reborn.</p><p>Even so, the human and darkin elements of this imperfect form are in constant flux, with each managing to wrest control for a short time before being reined in by the other. Varus fights to silence the two mortal souls once and for all, and wreak vengeance for the destruction of his race. Still, Kai and Val struggle against his malevolent influence, hoping against hope that their love can overcome the darkin\u2019s hatred.</p><p>How long they can keep Varus conflicted is anyone\u2019s guess\u2014but should this sadistic and egotistical killer come to fully dominate his new host, it is certain he will seek to reunite with others of his kind, and reduce all of Runeterra to an ashen wasteland.</p>",

Varus now seeks out those who trapped him, in order to enact his brutal vengeance, but the mortal souls within still resist him every step of the way.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Shauna Vayne is a deadly, remorseless monster hunter who has pledged her life to finding and killing the demon who murdered her family. Armed with her wrist-mounted crossbows and a heart full of vengeance, Vayne is only truly happy when she\u2019s slaying practitioners or creations of the dark arts.</p><p>As the only child to a wealthy Demacian couple, Vayne enjoyed an upbringing of privilege. She spent most of her childhood indulged in solitary pursuits \u2013 reading, learning music, and avidly collecting the various insects found on their manor\u2019s grounds. Her parents had traveled across Runeterra in their youth, but settled in Demacia after Shauna\u2019s birth because more than any place they\u2019d found, Demacians looked out for one another.</p><p>Shortly after Vayne\u2019s sixteenth birthday, she returned home from a midsummer banquet and saw something she would never forget. </p><p>An unspeakably beautiful, horned woman stood before the bloodied corpses of her parents.</p><p>Vayne screamed in agony and terror. Before disappearing, the demon looked down at the young girl and flashed her a terrible, lustful smile. </p><p>Vayne tried to brush the bloody hair out of her mother\u2019s eyes, but that haunting smile lingered in her mind, growing and consuming her. Even as she shakily smoothed her father\u2019s eyelids closed \u2013 his mouth still agape, frozen in his last horrific moments of confusion \u2013 the demon\u2019s smile seeped through her thoughts. </p><p>It was a smile that would fill Shauna\u2019s veins with hatred for the rest of her days.</p><p>Vayne tried to explain what happened, but no one truly believed her. The thought of a demon on the loose \u2013 in the well-defended, magic-averse kingdom of Demacia, of all places \u2013 was too far-fetched to consider.</p><p>Vayne knew better. She knew from the demon\u2019s smile the enchantress would strike again. Even Demacia\u2019s tall walls couldn\u2019t keep dark magic from creeping through the cracks. It may disguise itself with subtleties or keep to shadowed corners, but Vayne knew it was there. </p><p>And she was done being afraid.</p><p>Vayne had a heart full of hatred and enough coin to outfit a small army, but where she would go, no army dared follow. She needed to learn everything about dark magic: How to track it. How to stop it. How to kill those who practiced it.</p><p>She needed a teacher.</p><p>Her parents had told her stories of iceborn warriors who fought against an Ice Witch in the north. For generations, they had defended themselves from her unknowable forces and dark minions. This, Vayne knew, would be where she would find her tutor. She evaded her appointed custodians and booked passage on the next ship to the Freljord.</p><p>Shortly after arriving, Vayne set out in search of a monster hunter. She found one, although not in the way she intended. Traversing a frozen ravine, Vayne was ensnared by a cleverly carved icetrap. After tumbling to the bottom of a jagged, crystalline pit, Vayne stared up to see a ravenous ice troll, lips smacking with anticipation as he gazed upon his catch.</p><p>His gigantic blue tongue fell limp as a spear whistled through the air, pierced the troll\u2019s skull and planted itself deep in his brain. The giant toppled into the pit and Vayne rolled aside just in time to escape being crushed. A sticky pool of drool and blood collected at her boots.</p><p>Vayne\u2019s savior was a grizzled, middle-aged woman named Frey. She bandaged Vayne\u2019s wounds as they clung to the warmth of a campfire that struggled to stay ablaze in the frigid canyon. Frey told Vayne of her life\u2019s work spent fighting the Ice Witch\u2019s minions who had murdered her children. Vayne implored the woman to take her on as a student and teach her to track the dark creatures of the world, but the Freljordian had no interest. Vayne stank of privilege and money, neither of which kept your teeth gritted or your blade sharp through the grueling perseverance of a fight.</p><p>Vayne couldn\u2019t accept Frey\u2019s answer and challenged her to a duel: if she won, Frey would train her. If she lost, she\u2019d offer herself as bait to the Ice Witch\u2019s minions, so Frey could ambush them. Vayne had no reason to think she\u2019d win \u2013 her training amounted to a single afternoon of studying fencing before she wearied of trying to fight with one hand behind her back \u2013 but she refused to back down. To reward Vayne\u2019s mettle, Frey threw snow in Vayne\u2019s eyes and subsequently taught her the first rule of monster hunting: don\u2019t play fair.</p><p>Frey saw a determination in Vayne she couldn\u2019t help but respect. The girl had a long way to go as a fighter, but each time Vayne pushed her bruised body up from the dirtied snow to continue the fight, Frey saw a little more of the relentless hunter this girl could become. Beaten in skill, but never in spirit, Vayne beseeched Frey one last time: both of their families were dead. Frey could spend the rest of her days tracking ice trolls until one of them caved her head in, or she could teach Vayne. Together, they could kill twice as many monsters. Together, they could save twice as many families from experiencing the pain that defined them both. Frey saw the same hatred and loss in Vayne\u2019s eyes her own had burned with for years. </p><p>Frey agreed to accompany Vayne back to Demacia.</p><p>Together they made the journey south, heavily disguising Frey to illude Demacia\u2019s border guards. Once back at Vayne\u2019s estate, the two spent years training. Despite the pageant of suitors who solicited Vayne\u2019s company, Shauna had no interest in anything other than training with Frey. As a result, the two became incredibly close.</p><p>Frey taught Vayne the fundamentals of dark magic, conjured beasts, and vile spells. Vayne committed every word of Frey's teachings to heart, but found it slightly unnerving that Frey never explained how she came to know so many specifics of these malefic practices. </p><p>Due to the kingdom\u2019s watchful soldiers and antimagic trees, dark creatures were rare within Demacia's walls, so Frey and Vayne would venture into the border forests at night to hunt. Vayne earned her first kill \u2013 a bloodthirsty creature who preyed on traveling merchants \u2013 at the age of eighteen.</p><p>Soaked in the creature\u2019s viscera, something awoke within Vayne: pleasure. The hot flush of vengeance and violence raced through her blood, and she relished in the sensation. </p><p>Vayne and Frey spent several years hunting dark creatures, their respect for one another growing with every kill. One day, Vayne realized that she loved Frey like a mother, but her emotions of familial love were so tangled with pain and tainted by trauma, Vayne fought them as she would any beast out to hurt her.</p><p>Vayne and Frey traveled Valoran, until tavern tales from the highlands caught their ear, whispering of a demonic horned creature of mesmerizing beauty. According to the stories, the demon had been busy: she\u2019d formed a cult, designed to attract worshippers who would do her bidding. People would walk into the hills, never to be heard from again. It was said the cult\u2019s high priests had a holy grounds near the cliffside, where they\u2019d prepare the demon\u2019s sacrificial offerings. Vayne and Frey immediately set off on the hunt.</p><p>As they journeyed into the hills by cover of night, Vayne found herself distracted. For the first time since their partnership began, she felt worried for Frey \u2013 worried she might lose her mother figure for a second time. Before she could confess her fear, one of the demon\u2019s priests lunged from the brush, swinging a mace into Vayne\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Vayne was badly wounded. Frey had a brief moment of hesitation, but her eyes steeled with certainty as she apologized to her friend and transformed into a monstrous Freljordian wolf. As Vayne watched in shock, Frey \u2013 in her animalistic form \u2013 tore the priest\u2019s tendons from his throat with a swift snap of her mighty jaws.</p><p>With the priest\u2019s body laid strewn at Vayne\u2019s feet, Frey retook her human form, yet her eyes betrayed the scared animal within. She explained that after the death of her family, she had become a shaman, inviting the curse upon herself in order to gain the power to change shape and fight against the Ice Witch. The ritual that gave her these powers involved dark magic, but she made this sacrifice to protect\u2013</p><p>\u2013Vayne put an arrow through Frey\u2019s heart without allowing her another syllable. Whatever affection she had felt for Frey evaporated upon discovering her true nature. A tear formed in Frey\u2019s eye as she collapsed, but Vayne didn\u2019t notice \u2013 whatever warmth the two had shared died with Frey.</p><p>There were still hours left before dawn, which meant hours left to continue the hunt. Vayne thought only of the demon. The kill that would be hers to savor. And all the kills to come. Runeterra\u2019s underworld would come to fear her, just as she had once feared them.</p><p>For the first time since her parents\u2019 death, Vayne smiled.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>For most of the peoples of Runeterra, yordles are not typically something to be feared. Their fabled home of Bandle City is said to be a mysterious, spiritual place, filled with odd trinkets and keepsakes gathered from across the material realm. While these curious creatures often leave to dwell among mortal races for a time, they generally return with fresh tales and new experiences to recount.</p><p>Yet, sadly, there are also those yordles who lose their way. Among them is the sorcerer Veigar.</p><p>After the Great Darkin War left the world in ruin many centuries ago, the only light that seemed to shine on Valoran came from the skies above. Scattered survivors looked to the heavens, and their renewed study of ancient celestial magic piqued Veigar\u2019s interest. Imagining himself already a master of these mystical arts, the yordle joined an order of mages in the Noxii territories, hoping to learn more of their craft. They did not think to question this eager newcomer, and he taught them to draw hope from the patterns created by the movements of the stars.</p><p>But while many toiled to rebuild the world, others sought to conquer it. The brutal warlord Mordekaiser and his armies swept across the lands, crushing and enslaving any who would oppose his rule, and the mages of the order\u2014unskilled in war\u2014were of little value to this tyrant. Looming over them in his accursed battleplate, his keen eye fell upon Veigar, and Mordekaiser recognized the yordle for what he truly was. He snatched him up in one iron gauntlet, and dragged his prize away as the other mages were put to the sword.</p><p>Imprisoned in the heart of the warlord\u2019s new, monolithic fortress, Veigar was forced to turn his magic to darker purposes. Knowing that yordles were craftier than any of the mortal races, Mordekaiser bound Veigar to the physical plane, preventing him even from escaping to Bandle City. He was not the only captive in that hellish place, but such isolation was the worst and most cruel form of torture for a yordle. Veigar performed grisly enchantments against his will\u2014some strengthening his master\u2019s dominion, others simply evoking terror for terror\u2019s sake.</p><p>Indeed, terror was what seemed to fuel this dreadful empire. Miserable beyond imagining, Veigar became a reluctant witness as Mordekaiser's vile deeds empowered him to near-immortality. Whether it was over the course of decades or centuries, Veigar never knew, but eventually the yordle\u2019s magic and appearance started to twist in response\u2026</p><p>Memories of his past faded. Why had he come to Valoran? Where had he come from? Had he known any other life before this? Questions such as these weighed on his fragile mind, like the last flickers of light before an eclipse.</p><p>When the revenant warlord\u2019s own followers conspired against him, the nightmare of his reign was ended, but by this point Veigar was nigh unrecognizable. His eyes blazed. Even his voice had become a sneer of malice. Fleeing from his ensorcelled cage, the wretched creature had no interest in the wars of succession that inevitably followed. Deep down, he most likely yearned to regain the sense of safety and freedom that all living things crave.</p><p>And yet, he chose not to turn away from evil, but to embrace it. Clad in armor befitting a sinister warlock, he vowed to seize respect in the only way he could remember\u2014through ruthless villainy, inspiring fear in all who encountered him. He would call down the fury of the stars themselves upon his foes, and trap them in the timeless infinities between moments.</p><p>And yet\u2026 Veigar could not quite find the same success as his former captor.</p><p>Certainly, the good people of Valoran <i>did</i> learn to fear him, to some extent. More often than not, they would find their pastures scorched, or the local baron\u2019s mansion razed to its foundations. Sometimes though, inexplicably, bands of brigands would be driven from their woodland hideouts, or the remains of feral murk wolves found scattered through the town square, and it was difficult to tell whether these acts were malicious or actually reasonably helpful. For all his aspirations of evildoing, it seemed Veigar would always come up a tiny bit short.</p><p>Still, the nefarious yordle has not abandoned his quest to become the world\u2019s most wicked villain. With his diabolic staff in hand, he seeks nothing less than to bring all before him to their knees, and revels in the timely demise of those who dare to underestimate him.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>An enthusiastic yordle sorcerer, Veigar has embraced powers that few others dare even approach. As a free-spirited inhabitant of Bandle City, he once longed to learn more of the celestial magic practiced by mortals, but his natural curiosity was twisted by imprisonment in the Immortal Bastion. Now a stubborn creature with the dark fury of the stars at his command, Veigar is often underestimated by others\u2014and though he believes himself truly evil, there are some who still question his deeper motivations\u2026</p>",

It is the realm of the Void, where no mortal or immortal creature may ever walk. It is not necessary to know how such a place ever came to be, nor why\u2014only that it did. The Void is eternal. The Void consumes all.</p><p>In that place, in the cold, endless dark, all is equal and empty. For timeless eons, there was purity in that fact. There was peace, if such a term could have any meaning there.</p><p>Then, something changed. Not in the Void realm, but elsewhere. It was existence, it was... <i>something</i>, where before there had been nothing, and its mere presence scraped against the vast, cold, formless entities that drifted in the blackness. Before this, they had not even been fully aware of their own sentience, and yet now they knew that they could not tolerate the presence of this other place; this other-realm of mercurial, overwhelming creation.</p><p>The entities watched. They scrutinized.</p><p>And soon enough, the Watchers found themselves being scrutinized in return. The tiny, mortal minds that reached out to them were insignificant, little more than fleeting motes of light at the very edges of the abyss. Yet, in them, the Watchers saw a chance to invade the material realm, to destroy it, to silence the intolerable pulsing of reality beyond the Void.</p><p>The boldest of them tore open the veil and hurled themselves upward, only to be horribly disoriented by the sudden shift between the abyss and the corporeal, linear nature of reality. In an instant, there was <i>time</i>, and <i>heat</i>, and <i>pain</i>...</p><p>Then there was only cold. The way was shut, and dozens of the Watchers were trapped in the liminal space between two realms, frozen in the moment of transition.</p><p>Those that remained in the Void recoiled. They had no concept of what had happened, yet they knew they had been betrayed.</p><p>And so, they adapted.</p><p>Reaching into the material realm, the Watchers took from the crude matter that comprised it, shaping, corrupting and imbuing it with consciousness. These constructs were the first of the Voidborn, and would be their masters\u2019 eyes and ears, sent forth into the nightmare of existence to watch, listen, and learn.</p><p>Among them, one stands apart. As perhaps the oldest surviving Voidborn, certainly existing the longest outside of the abyss, he has been known by countless names to those unfortunate enough to encounter him. Thousands of years before Icathia unleashed the Void in battle, the primitive cultures of Shurima feared the devil <i>Vel\u2019Koz</i>, who crept forth from the underworld to steal the dreams of wiser men. Though his name has no literal translation in the modern tongue, it equates roughly as \u201cto understand by unmaking.\u201d</p><p>His insatiable hunger for knowledge has led Vel\u2019Koz across the world, to its highest peaks and darkest depths. Cunning and methodical, he has quietly watched entire civilizations rise, stagnate and decay, spent centuries combing the ocean floor for its secrets, even scrying the movements of the stars in the heavens above him.</p><p>He carries all of this knowledge back to the great rifts in the fabric of Runeterra\u2014so that the Watchers might know what he knows\u2014and will annihilate, without hesitation, any mortal who stands in his path.</p><p>For the Void is eternal, and it will consume us all.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>It is unclear if Vel\u2019Koz was the first Voidborn to emerge on Runeterra, but there has certainly never been another to match his level of cruel, calculating sentience. While his kin devour or defile everything around them, he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical realm\u2014and the strange, warlike beings that dwell there\u2014for any weakness the Void might exploit. But Vel\u2019Koz is far from a passive observer, striking back at threats with deadly plasma, or by disrupting the very fabric of the world itself.</p>",

With an endless supply of malaise and a powerful shadow in tow, Vex shields herself from the pep and happiness of the outside world, and all of the irksome \u201cnormies\u201d who occupy it.</p><p>Growing up in Bandle City, Vex never felt she belonged. The whimsy and color of the yordle realm was cloying to her. Despite the best efforts of her parents, she never seemed to find her \u201cyordle spirit\u201d or any like-minded friends, and chose to spend most of her time sulking in her room.</p><p>There, she found an unlikely soulmate in her own shadow. It was black (her favorite color), and it didn\u2019t talk\u2014the perfect companion for the sullen youth. She learned to entertain herself with the shadow, performing gloomy pantomimes for her own amusement.</p><p>Alas, it was just a shadow, incapable of shielding Vex from the loathsome cheerfulness that surrounded her. Surely something more lay in store. Something darker. Something sad. Something <i>just like her</i>.</p><p>That <i>something</i> arrived in the form of a Harrowing, thick clouds of Black Mist that billowed through Bandle City, stirring its residents to panic. While most yordles fought valiantly to beat back the Mist, Vex was intrigued by the foul miasma and began to follow it to its source.</p><p>When she arrived in the Shadow Isles, Vex couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. Vast tracts of land and sea, devoid of all life and color, stretched out before her. Here, she could finally sulk, unbothered by the laughter and merriment of others.</p><p>As the days passed, Vex realized the Black Mist was having a strange effect on her. Her shadow had taken on a new ghostly persona\u2014much more lively and expressive than its host\u2014and her benign yordle magic had transformed into something far more sinister. Vex could now spread her misery far and wide.</p><p>\u201cWho made this wonderfully awful place?\u201d she wondered.</p><p>Her question was soon answered when the Ruined King, Viego, appeared in the Isles, seeking to spread his Mist to all corners of Runeterra. Upon meeting Vex, Viego realized the yordle had a unique ability to spread despair, making people more vulnerable to his Harrowing. Vex, in turn, was inspired by his vision for a world covered in Black Mist. The two became fast allies and set out to turn the entire world into a harrowed wasteland.</p><p>Before Viego\u2019s vision could be fully realized, Vex discovered his ulterior motive: to reclaim the soul of his dead queen Isolde, and reunite with her in matrimonial bliss. She shuddered in disgust, feeling betrayed that the man she had trusted to kill the world\u2019s happiness had, in fact, been seeking it himself. Vex left Viego to be defeated by the Sentinels of Light, his dreams of a matrimonial reunion dashed upon the stones of the Camavoran wreckage. Alone once more, she watched in disappointment as the world returned to the bright, colorful place she had always hated. Finding a lasting melancholy was going to be tougher than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>She knew one last place she could go\u2014a surefire way to achieve the misery she craved. She paid a visit to her parents in Bandle City, eager to show them who she had become and bask in their disapproval.</p><p>The young yordle watched as her parents turned dumbstruck, still as tree stumps. Their expressions changed from shock, to denial, to reluctant acceptance.</p><p>\u201cHoney. We don\u2019t understand... <i>this</i>,\u201d said her mother, motioning with her finger at Vex\u2019s entire being.</p><p>\u201cBut we love you unconditionally,\u201d said her father. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re happy, we\u2019re happy <i>for</i> you.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Vex released a loud, exasperated sigh. \u201cYou guys are the worst,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>She trudged out of her parents\u2019 living room, anxious to return to the Shadow Isles where she could sulk undisturbed.</p>",

Running with the sump-snipe gangs, she quickly learned to use her wits, as well as her fists, to survive. Everyone who encountered Vi knew she could talk\u2014or punch\u2014her way out of trouble. More often than not, she chose the latter.</p><p>None of the old-timers from her youth could tell her anything of her parents. Most assumed they had died in one of the industrial accidents that were, sadly, all too common in the undercity. Though she had ended up in the crumbling Hope House orphanage, a notoriously mad sump-scrapper claimed to have found her adrift in a bassinet large enough for two in the ruins of a collapsed chem-lab. In the end, Vi figured some things were best left unknown.</p><p>With her wild pink hair, she became a distinctive sight on the streets of Zaun\u2014hightailing from angry shopkeepers in the boundary markets, swaggering through the colorful bazaars of the Black Lanes, or hitching rides up into Piltover aboard the hexdraulic conveyors. Wherever there was a scrape to be gotten into or a scam to be run, Vi was in the thick of it, though she never stole from those that couldn\u2019t cover the loss\u2026 and never hurt those that didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>As she got older, the capers of childhood became more audacious and daring, and Vi formed a gang of her own. Brash and quick to anger, she still relied on her fists a little too much, and was rarely without a black eye or split lip.</p><p>She found a mentor in the owner of a bar on the edge of the Lanes, who tempered some of her more self-destructive tendencies. He tried to reinforce her moral code, and showed her how to fight with discipline, as well as teaching her ways to better direct her simmering anger.</p><p>In time, Vi earned a reputation as someone who got things done, no questions asked.</p><p>Listening to the chatter of the Zaunite miners who frequented the bar, she came to learn when big deals were being made, and how payments were to be delivered. To a chem-baron, this was chump change\u2014but to her and her friends, it would be a fortune. She planned a heist, but knew it would require extra bodies to pull off, so Vi reluctantly brought a rival gang, the Factorywood Fiends, in on her score.</p><p>Everything was going fine, until the leader of the Fiends killed the mine owner with a pair of oversized pulverizer gauntlets, and trapped the rest of the workers in the tunnels. Even as both gangs fled with the loot, Vi knew she could not leave these innocent people to die. She snatched up the gauntlets, the wrist mechanisms clamping down painfully on her arms, but she endured the agony long enough to smash open a path to free the miners.</p><p>The following day, Vi paid a visit to the Factorywood Fiends. Still wearing the powered gauntlets, she took on the entire gang, administering a beating so legendary that it is still spoken of in the Lanes to this day.</p><p>Vi eventually disappeared from Zaun during a time of great upheaval, when tensions with Piltover were running high. Rumors circulated between the gangs that she had been killed in a huge explosion in the heart of the undercity, or that she had turned her back on her friends and struck out for distant lands. The truth, however, finally came to light when Old Hungry\u2019s Scars\u2014a vicious gang whose murder sprees had spread topside\u2014were brought down by a respected sheriff of Piltover and her new ally\u2026 Vi.</p><p>The former gang leader was now in the employ of the Wardens, and she had replaced the chem-powered pulverizer gauntlets with a pair of brand new hextech Atlas prototypes.</p><p>No one yet knows the exact reason why or <i>how</i> Vi came to be working alongside Caitlyn\u2014but given the anarchic nature of the crime wave now sweeping Piltover, speculation runs rife that it might involve a certain blue-haired hellion from Zaun\u2026</p>",

Growing up all but alone, Vi developed finely honed survival instincts as well as a wickedly abrasive sense of humor. Now working with the Wardens to keep the peace in Piltover, she wields mighty hextech gauntlets that can punch through walls\u2014and suspects\u2014with equal ease.",

Fewer still know of its foolish young ruler, whose lovestruck heart was doomed to destroy it.</p><p>Now a grave threat to all, that man\u2019s name was\u2014and is\u2014Viego.</p><p>The second son of a dynastic king, Viego was never intended to lead. Instead, he lived a life of comfort that made him complacent and selfish. Yet, when his older brother died unexpectedly, Viego, who possessed neither the inclination nor the aptitude for rulership, suddenly found himself crowned.</p><p>He showed little interest in his position until he met a poor seamstress, Isolde. So taken was he by her beauty that the young king offered her his hand in marriage, and thus, one of the most powerful rulers of the age was wed to a peasant girl.</p><p>Their romance was enchanting, and Viego, who\u2019d rarely shown interest in anyone other than himself, devoted his life to her. The two were inseparable\u2014he scarcely went anywhere without Isolde, always lavishing gifts upon his queen, and his attention could seldom be broken when she was present.</p><p>Viego\u2019s allies fumed. Unable to interest him in governance, and with the nation beginning to unravel under his questionable rulership, some plotted in secret to end their new king\u2019s reign before it had begun. His nation\u2019s enemies, meanwhile, saw an opportunity to strike. And the vipers began to circle.</p><p>Thus did an assassin\u2019s poisoned dagger one day come for Viego. But the king was well defended, and the dagger did not strike true\u2014instead grazing Isolde.</p><p>The toxin worked quickly, and Isolde fell into a ruinous torpor, while Viego could only watch in horror as his wife\u2019s condition grew ever more serious. Overwhelmed with fury and despair, he spent every last coin within his coffers trying to save her.</p><p>But it was all for naught. Isolde perished in her bed, and Viego was consumed by madness.</p><p>His search for an antidote became desperate, crazed. Unable to accept his wife\u2019s death, every treasure of the kingdom\u2014every scrap of wealth\u2014was sacrificed to his quest to return her to him. As the land fell into disarray, Viego hid himself away with Isolde\u2019s body, becoming hateful and violent.</p><p>Then came the day he learned the secret of the Blessed Isles, of its water that healed any ailment. With his great army, he stormed the peaceful country by force, slaughtering everyone who stood in his way until he at last breached its inner sanctum and let his wife drift beneath the blessed water. She would return to him, no matter the destruction he wrought. No matter the cost.</p><p>And for just one moment, she did.</p><p>Isolde arose a horrifying wraith of shadow and rage, and in her pain, her anger, her confusion at being ripped from death, she took Viego\u2019s own enchanted blade and thrust it through his heart. The magic of the waters and the ancient sword clashed, and the chamber\u2019s energy erupted, tearing across the Isles and trapping everything it touched in tortured, conscious undeath.</p><p>Yet of this, Viego remembers nothing. His country collapsed into ruin, great nations rose and fell, and in time, even his name was forgotten... until, a thousand years after his death, Viego stood once more. And this time, he would not fail.</p><p>His mind twisted by the same dangerous obsession he possessed in life, Viego\u2019s unflinching, deranged love fuels his every action, his every desire, his every atrocity. The deadly Black Mist pours freely from Viego\u2019s broken heart\u2014ripping the life from everything it touches\u2014and he uses the Mist to scour the world for some way to return Isolde to his side.</p><p>Legions will fall before him only to rise again in his service, continents will be swallowed by living darkness, and the world will pay for every moment of happiness it stole from an ancient ruler laid low by all-consuming love. He cares naught for the destruction he causes, so long as he can see Isolde\u2019s face again.</p><p>His reign is terror.</p><p>His love is eternal.</p><p>And until Isolde returns to him, all will fall before the Ruined King.</p>",

Abandoning his work, even for a short time, was anathema to Viktor.</p><p>In a bid to impose a level of order and certainty on his world, Viktor researched Zaun\u2019s many accidents and came to realize that almost all of them were the result of human error, not mechanical failure. He offered his services to the local businesses, developing inventions that made them far safer working environments.

Soon, other establishments sought his work and Viktor\u2019s designs became common in Zaun, improving production with every innovation that removed human error from a process. Eventually, at the age of nineteen, he was surprised to be offered a place in Zaun\u2019s prestigious Academy of Techmaturgy. But Viktor\u2019s work had attracted the eye of Professor Stanwick of Piltover, who convinced him to leave Zaun and travel to Piltover\u2019s academy instead. There, he could work in the most advanced laboratories and gain access to all the resources the City of Progress could offer. Thrilled to be singled out, Viktor accepted his offer and took up residence in Piltover, where he refined his craft and sought to perfect his theorems in ways that would benefit everyone.</p><p>Viktor worked with Piltover\u2019s best and brightest; including an insufferable genius named Jayce. The two were equally matched in intellect, but where Viktor was methodical, logical and thorough, Jayce was flamboyant and arrogant. The two worked together frequently, but never truly became friends. Often, the two would butt heads over their perceptions of intuition vs logic in the process of invention, but a level of mutual respect developed as each saw the flawed brilliance in the other.</p><p>In the midst of his studies in Piltover, a major chem-spill devastated entire districts of Zaun, and Viktor returned home to offer his help in the rescue efforts. By grafting a sophisticated series of cognitive loops upon existing automata-technology, he crafted a custom-built golem, Blitzcrank, to help in the clean-up. Blitzcrank was instrumental in saving scores of lives and appeared to develop a level of sentience beyond anything Viktor had envisioned.</p><p>Even with the spill contained, Viktor remained in Zaun to help those afflicted by the released toxins. With the golem\u2019s help, he attempted to use his techmaturgical brilliance to save those whose lives had been blighted by the spill. Their attempt was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing more deaths, and the two parted ways. Though Viktor was distraught at the loss of life in Zaun, the work taught him a great deal about the merging of human anatomy with technology and how mortal anatomy could be enhanced with technology.</p><p>When Viktor returned to Piltover, weeks later, it was to find that Professor Stanwick had held a symposium on Blitzcrank and presented Viktor\u2019s researches as his own. Viktor lodged formal complaints with the masters of the college, but his impassioned claim that he had designed Blitzcrank fell on deaf ears. He turned to Jayce to verify his claims, but his fellow student refused to speak up, further widening the rift between them, and the matter was decided in Professor Stanwick\u2019s favor.</p><p>Bitter, but resigned, Viktor returned to his studies, knowing that his ultimate goal of making people\u2019s lives better and enhancing humanity was more important than one stolen project and a bruised ego. He continued to excel, finding ever new ways to eliminate human error and weakness from his work, a facet of his researches that came to dominate his thinking. He saw human involvement in any part of a process as a grossly inefficient aberration - a view that put him at odds with a great many of his fellow students and professors, who saw the very things Viktor sought to remove as the source of human ingenuity and creativity.</p><p>This came to a head during a reluctant collaboration with Jayce to improve the diving suits used to keep Piltover\u2019s docks clear of underwater debris and lingering chemical waste. Viktor and Jayce\u2019s enhanced suits allowed the wearer to go deeper, remain underwater for longer, and lift heavier weights. But many wearers claimed they saw phantom corpse lights in the depths or suffered from chem-induced hallucinations. When divers experienced such symptoms, they panicked and often got themselves or their fellow divers killed. Viktor saw the problem was not technical, but with the wearer\u2019s nerves unraveling in the inky depths. He devised a chem-shunt helm that allowed an operator on the surface to bypass the wearer\u2019s fear response and, effectively, control the diver. A heated discussion between Viktor and Jayce on free will and mental enslavement turned bitter - almost violent - and the two vowed never to work together again.</p><p>Jayce reported the incident to the college masters, and Viktor was censured for violating basic human dignity - though, in his eyes, his work would have saved many lives. He was expelled from the college, and retreated to his old laboratory in Zaun, disgusted by the narrow-minded perceptions of Piltover\u2019s inhabitants. Alone in the depths, Viktor sank into a deep depression, enduring a traumatic period of introspection for many weeks. He wrestled with the ethical dilemma he now faced, finding that, once again, human emotion and weakness had stood in his way. He had been trying to help, to enhance people beyond their natural capabilities to avoid error and save lives. Revelation came when he realized that he too had succumbed to such emotions, allowing his naive belief that good intentions could overcome ingrained prejudice to blind him to human failings. Viktor knew he could not expect others to follow where he did not go first, so, in secret, he operated on himself to remove those parts of his flesh and psyche that relied upon or were inhibited by emotion.</p><p>When the surgery was done, almost no trace of the young man who had traveled to Piltover remained. He had supplanted the majority of his anatomy with mechanical augmentations, but his personality had also changed. His idealistic hope to better society was refined into an obsession with what he called the Glorious Evolution. Viktor now saw himself as the pioneer of Valoran's future - an idealized dream where man would renounce flesh in favor of superior hextech augmentations. This would free humanity from fatal errors and suffering, though Viktor knew it was a task that would not be completed easily or quickly.</p><p>He threw himself into this great work with a vengeance. He used technological augmentations to help rebuild Zaunites injured in accidents, perfected breathing mechanisms, and worked tirelessly to reduce human inefficiency by decoupling physicality from emotion. His work saved hundreds of lives, yet seeking Viktor\u2019s help could be dangerous, as his solutions often brought unexpected consequences.</p><p>But if you were desperate, Viktor was the man you went to.</p><p>Some in Zaun, hearing fragments of his philosophy and seeing the successes of his work, saw him as a messianic figure. Viktor couldn\u2019t care less for them, viewing their quasi-religious cult as an aberration; yet another reason to eliminate emotional foibles and the belief in that which could not be empirically proven.</p><p>After a toxic event in the Sump saw hundreds of men and women in the Factorywood transformed into rabid psychotics, Viktor was forced to use a powerful soporific to sedate the victims and bring them back to his labs to try and undo the damage. The toxins had begun to eat away portions of their brains, but Viktor was able to slow the degenerative process by opening up their craniums and employing machinery to slowly filter their bloodstreams of poison. The technology available to him wasn\u2019t up to the task, and Viktor knew many people were going to die unless he found a way to greatly enhance his purgative machinery.</p><p>As he fought to save these people, he detected a surge in hextech energy from Piltover and saw immediately that this could give him the power he needed. He followed the powerful energy surge to its source. </p><p>Jayce\u2019s lab.</p><p>Viktor demanded Jayce hand over the source of this power, a pulsing crystal from the Shuriman desert. But his former colleague refused, leaving Viktor no option but to take it by force. He returned to Zaun and hooked the strange crystal to his machinery, readying a steam golem host for each afflicted person in case their body gave out under the stress of the procedure. Empowered by the new crystal, Viktor\u2019s machines went to work and, gradually, the damage from the toxins began to reverse. His work would save these people - in a manner of speaking - and had Viktor retained more than a fragment of his humanity, he might have celebrated. As it was, the barest hint of a smile was all he allowed himself.</p><p>Before the process could complete, a vengeful Jayce burst in and started smashing the laboratory with an energized hammer. Knowing an arrogant fool like Jayce would never listen to reason, Viktor ordered the automatons to kill Jayce. The battle was ferocious, and only ended when Jayce shattered the crystal Viktor had taken, bringing the entire warehouse down in an avalanche of steel and stone, thus ending the existence of those Viktor was trying to save. And for this, Jayce returned to Piltover, feted as a hero.</p><p>Viktor escaped the destruction of the laboratory, and returned to his mission of bettering humanity by ridding it of its destructive emotional impulses. In Viktor\u2019s mind, Jayce\u2019s impetuous attack only proved the truth of his cause and strengthened his desire to unburden humanity of the failings of flesh. Viktor did send chem-augmented thugs to raid Jayce\u2019s laboratory not long afterward. This was - Viktor told himself - not for revenge, but to learn if there were any more shards of the Shuriman crystal he could use for the advancement of mankind. The raid was unsuccessful, however, and Viktor thought no more of Jayce.</p><p>Instead, he intensified his efforts to find ways in which humanity could be shepherded beyond their emotional weaknesses and brought into a new, more reasoned stage of their evolution. Such researches sometimes transgress the boundaries of what would be considered ethical in Piltover (and Zaun), but they are all necessary steps in bringing about Viktor\u2019s Glorious Evolution.</p>",

He was present at the dawn of the empire, and has since woven his influence deep into its foundations\u2026 but he remembers little of those days. His mind is mortal, and so most of his unnaturally extended life endures not in his memory, but in his chronicles.</p><p>History has lost track of Vladimir on many occasions, though its pages are littered with figures suspected to have been him. Legend once told of a prince in a kingdom threatened by the infamous darkin, as their great war spilled into Valoran. With his father\u2019s crown at stake, and many more heirs ahead of him in the line of succession, the unfortunate youth was traded to the fallen god-warriors as a hostage.</p><p>Mortals were little more than cattle under the tyranny of the darkin, their supremacy apparent in the sorceries they had conceived\u2014the arts of crafting flesh and transmuting blood, granting them mastery over life itself.</p><p>Believing himself above other mortal vassals, and therefore worthy of such power, Vladimir was the first of his kind permitted to study this terrifying magic. His devotion earned him a place of favor in his patron\u2019s warhost, and the right to practice hemomancy and enforce the darkin\u2019s will on lesser beings. Over time, the god-warrior watched with amusement as Vladimir came to govern his subjects with as little mercy as the darkin themselves.</p><p>The fall of these cruel tyrants is, likewise, the stuff of legend. An account of it, written in the dead High Shuriman language, is kept hidden within the Immortal Bastion. It speculates that Vladimir\u2019s master was not imprisoned like so many of his kin, but instead died at the hands of his own warhost. The few surviving mortals fled, taking what knowledge they had of blood magic with them.</p><p>Unknown to all but Vladimir himself, it was he who struck the killing blow. Scarred, blinded, driven mad by the radiance of a darkin\u2019s undoing, he absorbed enough power to renew flesh that was never meant to last beyond a mortal lifespan.</p><p>And he has done this countless times since, through rituals too vile to speak of.</p><p>At the height of Mordekaiser\u2019s dark reign, it was said that a mythic and bloodthirsty fiend haunted the coastal cliffs of eastern Valoran, demanding young lives and savage worship from the local tribes. Few were welcome in his lair, until the day a pale sorceress approached this barbarian god with an offer. The two feasted together as equals, weaving magic so dark that the wine at their table soured, and the roses withered, vibrant red turning to black.</p><p>Thus began the pact between Vladimir and LeBlanc, rife with disputes, and games of politics and war. Over the centuries, others joined them\u2014powerful nobles, exalted masters of magic, and beings darker still. This cabal grew into the hidden power that would guide the throne of Noxus for more than a thousand years, orchestrating many of the empire\u2019s most ambitious campaigns.</p><p>Uniquely among the leaders of the Black Rose, Vladimir has rarely limited himself to scheming from the shadows. In the past, he deigned to join the Noxian noble courts during the most <i>interesting</i> of times, only to fade into seclusion decades later, his extreme age\u2014and the atrocities his sorcery could wreak\u2014a well-kept secret. Even so, under Vladimir\u2019s tutelage, the art of hemomancy has found a place in the military of Noxus, and among scions of the old aristocracy. Among these diverse practitioners is the Crimson Circle, a youthful cult dedicated as much to Vladimir\u2019s personality as to blood magic itself.</p><p>With the death of the previous Grand General and the rise of Jericho Swain, the political landscape of the empire changed dramatically, and Vladimir has been forced to rouse himself once more.</p><p>Wearing the guise of a benevolent socialite, he has returned to the public eye as a vocal opponent of the ruling Trifarix council\u2026 much to the concern of more <i>cautious</i> members of the Black Rose. Indeed, his reappearance may have come too soon, as time has not yet washed away all the stains of his previous lifetime, and it seems likely that Swain himself has begun to grasp Vladimir\u2019s true nature.</p><p>As a new and darker conflict approaches Noxus, Vladimir drinks deeply from the renewed vitality of the empire, reminding himself of his past glories. To him, this life is a mere revelry, a masquerade spanning centuries, and the prologue to greatness\u2014for though the darkin eventually fought amongst themselves and lost their immortal grip on the world, Vladimir knows he is strongest alone.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>A fiend with a thirst for mortal blood, Vladimir has influenced the affairs of Noxus since the empire\u2019s earliest days. In addition to unnaturally extending his life, his mastery of hemomancy allows him to control the minds and bodies of others as easily as his own. In the flamboyant salons of the Noxian aristocracy, this enabled him to build a fanatical cult of personality around himself\u2014while in the lowest back alleys, it allows him to bleed his enemies dry.</p>",

But to most of the tribes who still hold to the old ways, he is known as the Volibear.</p><p>Destruction, strength, and the storm made manifest, the Volibear represents the unstoppable power and fury of the Freljord itself. It was the Volibear and his demi-god kin who formed the land they called <i>Vorrijaard</i> long before the arrival of the mortal races. The sagas tell how he created the Five Fjords with one mighty swipe of his claws, and how his epic battle with the savage magma-serpent, Rhond, formed countless valleys and ravines. When the Volibear finally felled the beast, its blood became the first river in the Freljord, and its colossal corpse formed the Wyrmback Mountains.</p><p>In the days of the first tribes, wild magic ran rampant. The Volibear was venerated and worshipped by all, for they needed his indomitable strength to survive. Great wars were waged, and the Volibear took to the field alongside his followers, clad in rune-inscribed armor made by his brother Ornn, demi-god of the forge. At the time, the brothers\u2019 bond was strong\u2014they often fought at each other\u2019s side, even though Ornn never had quite the same lust for battle. The Volibear reveled in hard-fought victories, and as ever more blood offerings were made to him, his power swelled.</p><p>In time, the Volibear and his kin drifted apart, each focusing on their own pursuits. Even so, there was no true division between them\u2026 until new ideas began to usurp the old beliefs.</p><p>Three sisters rose to power, seeking to control and impose order on the Freljord, and the demi-gods could not agree on how to proceed. A few, like Anivia, seemed inclined to work with the sisters, while the Volibear and the Iron Boar wanted to destroy them. Others would have been content to ignore them completely, since these feeble creatures would eventually die like all before them.</p><p>The Volibear looked to the most animalistic and savage of his followers, known as the Ursine. With them, he would defeat the three sisters. In preparation, he sought out Ornn to arm his warriors for battle.</p><p>But Ornn refused. He did not approve of the Ursine\u2019s savage ways, and a terrible fight erupted between the two demi-gods. In the aftermath, the Volibear cursed his brother\u2019s name, and cast off his rune-inscribed armor. He would fight from then on with just tooth, and claw, and might, and thunder. Far from being lessened, the Volibear found his full power was now unleashed.</p><p>With newfound rage, he confronted one of the mortal sisters who sought to steal the power of the demi-gods for herself. Before her entire army, he struck her down, blinding her\u2014but he was unable to stop what she had already set in motion.</p><p>As the centuries rolled by, and despite the Volibear\u2019s resistance, tribes began to venerate and worship the Three Sisters instead.</p><p>Many of the more ancient practices were forgotten. He saw tribes cowering behind stone walls rather than face the rawness of nature. He saw fields being tilled, and farmers herding cattle rather than hunting. He bellowed in fury to see great rivers dammed rather than be allowed to roar free. This was not <i>his</i> Freljord. The change had happened slowly\u2014glacially\u2014but the Volibear finally came to realize that the tribes had been cut off from the wild spirit of the land, making them frail, compliant, and soft. These weaklings had no reverence for the old ways, or old gods.</p><p>Anger and determination rumbled within him. He vowed to tear down all evidence of civilization and return the Freljord to its ancient state as a true wilderness. The people would become strong once more. He would again be honored and feared by all.</p><p>As the call of the Volibear reverberates across the mountains and plains of the north, more and more Freljordians are responding. Slowly, the old ways are being remembered and re-embraced, and his strength grows with each new follower.</p><p>A reckoning of blood awaits\u2026 and the Volibear is rushing toward it.</p>",

Destructive, wild, and stubbornly resolute, he existed before mortals walked the Freljord\u2019s tundra, and is fiercely protective of the lands that he and his demi-god kin created. Cultivating a deep hatred of civilization and the weakness it brought with it, he now fights to return to the old ways\u2014when the land was untamed, and blood spilled freely\u2014and eagerly battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination.",

Transformed by agonizing experiments, his body is fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with alchemical rage. Bursting out of the shadows, he preys upon those criminals who terrorize the city\u2019s depths. Warwick is drawn to blood, and driven mad by its scent. None who spill it can escape him.</p><p>Though many think of Warwick as no more than a beast, buried beneath the fury lies the mind of a man\u2014a gangster who put down his blade and took up a new name to live a better life. But no matter how hard he tried to move on, he could never escape the sins of his past.</p><p>Memories of that time come to Warwick in flashes before they\u2019re inevitably lost, replaced by searing echoes of the days he spent strapped to a table in Singed\u2019s lab, the mad chemist\u2019s face looming above him.</p><p>His world a haze of pain, Warwick could not recall how he fell into Singed\u2019s grasp\u2026 and even struggled to remember a time before the suffering began. The scientist patiently carved into him, installing pumps and hoses to inject chemicals into his veins, seeking what an alchemist always seeks: transmutation. </p><p>Singed would reveal his subject\u2019s true nature\u2014the deadly beast hidden within a \u201cgood man.\u201d</p><p>The chemicals pumped into Warwick\u2019s veins boosted his healing, allowing Singed to gradually and painfully reshape the man. When his hand was severed in the course of the experiment, Singed was able to reattach it, augmenting it with powerful, pneumatic claws, and bringing Warwick ever closer to his true potential. </p><p>A chemical chamber was installed on Warwick\u2019s back and integrated with his nervous system. Whenever he felt rage, or hate, or fear, it would drive liquid fury deeper into his veins, fully awakening the beast within.</p><p>He was forced to endure it all, every cut of the mad chemist\u2019s scalpel. Pain, Singed assured his subject, was necessary; it would prove to be the \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d of his transformation. Though the chemicals enabled Warwick\u2019s body to heal through most of the physical damage, his mind was shattered by the unending agony.</p><p>Warwick struggled to recall a single memory from his past... All he could see was blood. But then he heard a little girl screaming. Screaming something he couldn\u2019t understand. It sounded like a name.</p><p>He\u2019d already forgotten his. He sensed that was for the best.</p><p>Pain soon overwhelmed all other thoughts. Blood was the only thing left.</p><p>Though his body and mind were broken after weeks on the slab, Warwick stubbornly resisted the chemicals transmuting him. Toxins leaked from his eyes in place of tears. He coughed up gobs of caustic phlegm that sizzled against his chest, before burning shallow holes in the floor of the lab. Restrained against the cold steel of the table, Warwick writhed in agony for hours on end, until his body finally gave out.</p><p>With the untimely death of his subject, Singed disposed of the corpse in a charnel pit deep in Zaun\u2019s Sump, before turning his mind to the next experiment. </p><p>But death proved to be the true catalyst needed for Warwick\u2019s transformation. As he lay cooling atop the pile of corpses, the chemicals could finally complete their work. The chamber on his back began to pump.</p><p>His body contorted unnaturally, bones bending and snapping, teeth growing, sinews tearing and then healing with a faint alchemical glow, dead flesh replaced by something new and powerful. By the time his heart started beating once again, the man Warwick had been and the lives he\u2019d lived were gone.</p><p>He awoke to hunger. Everything hurt. Only one thing mattered.</p><p>He needed blood.</p><p>First, it was the blood of a nearby sump-scrapper, rooting through the charnel pile. And then a priestess of the Glorious Evolved, seeking a member of her flock. Then a Piltovan apprenta taking a shortcut, and a philter-faced merchant avoiding a gang, and a dram-dealer, and a tallyman, and a chem punk...</p><p>He set up a den not far from a place that itched at the back of his now-animal mind. There, he continued the slaughter, not caring who fell to his claws. So long as blood dripped from gnashing teeth, he would feel nothing but a smear of red on his conscience, the hunger in his gut overwhelming any concern for his random victims.</p><p>Yet, even as he surrendered to the beast, glimpses of his past began to haunt him. He saw a bearded man reflected in the eyes of a beggar as he tore out his throat. The other man looked somber, somehow familiar; there were scars on his arms. Sometimes, as he fed in dark alleys on stray gangers, the flash of knives would remind him of an old blade covered in blood. Blood passing from the blade to his hands. From his hands, to everything he touched. Sometimes, he remembered the girl again.</p><p>And still there was blood.</p><p>It had always been there, he realized, his entire life, and nothing he did could wash it off. He\u2019d left so many scars that even if he didn\u2019t remember his past, the city would. When he peered into the eyes of Zaun\u2019s criminals\u2014the gang bosses, murderers, and thieves\u2014he saw himself. The chamber on his back would fill his body with hate. His claws tore out of his fingers.</p><p>He hunted.</p><p>No longer content to kill indiscriminately, Warwick now pursues those already covered in the stench of blood. Just as he was the day he was dragged to Singed\u2019s door.</p><p>He still wonders if he\u2019d truly wanted this. He can\u2019t remember details, but he remembers enough. Enough to know Singed had been right all along\u2014the good man had been a lie, before disaster had burned it away, revealing the truth.</p><p>He is Warwick. He is a killer.</p><p>And there are so many killers to hunt.</p>",

A cautious people, they see life as an evolutionary climb to wisdom\u2014upon death, they believe they become stones, returning to the soil to begin the climb of life anew.</p><p>Impulsive, clever, and easily bored, young Kong never had much in common with other Shimon. For countless years, they endured his pranks\u2026 until the day he arrived in a panic, insisting that a great elemental dragon was coming to burn their woodland home.</p><p>But Kong only chuckled as his tribe began to flee. Realizing he had fooled them, and with their patience finally at an end, the Shimon named him outcast. Kong, for his part, was ambivalent. He would seek out people with a better sense of humor.</p><p>Living as something of a charlatan, he proclaimed himself \u201cthe Monkey King\u201d and often challenged mortals to duels, or games of cunning. He claimed to be undefeated\u2014until he crossed a Noxian headsman in the hinterlands of Zhyun. The Noxian and his comrades chased the Monkey King deep into the wilderness, where he hid, only emerging again after the invaders left the shores of the First Lands for good.</p><p>And in time, Kong saw the brutality Noxus had inflicted upon his homeland.</p><p>He set out to meet the fabled combat-masters of Wuju, but found that their village had been annihilated. The only living soul was a man sitting quietly among the ruins, so Kong challenged him to a good-natured fight. In a single motion, the man stood, knocked the vastaya down, then resumed his meditation.</p><p>For weeks, Kong returned again and again, determined to defeat this dour man\u2014but the Monkey King was always outmaneuvered, no matter if he approached from behind, above, or below. The warrior could sense whenever Kong was about to attack, even when the vastaya tried to distract him with <i>hilarious</i> jokes, and he somehow knew not to drink his tea when Kong laced it with stupefying spirits.</p><p>Eventually, the Monkey King knelt before the man and begged to learn his ways. Kong wanted to be the greatest warrior, but he also sought something more. He just couldn\u2019t quite put it into words.</p><p>The man saw Kong\u2019s humility, and knew the vastaya was ready. He introduced himself as Yi, the last master of Wuju, and agreed to train Kong in its virtues of discipline and patience. He could help channel Kong\u2019s recklessness and impulsiveness into a lethally swift and surprising fighting style.</p><p>The two grew to respect each other, yet Yi refused to speak much of his past, or why he would not leave the ruined village. Kong made a proposition. The two would engage in a friendly sparring bout. If Kong won, Yi had to reveal why he\u2019d stopped fighting. If Yi prevailed, Kong wouldn\u2019t speak for four full seasons.</p><p>Yi eagerly accepted.</p><p>When Kong had first arrived at Wuju, he crept through a field of smokepoppies, and he lured his master back there now. Each time Yi attacked, the agitated flowers would burst around him\u2014until finally he struck out through the growing haze at what he <i>believed</i> was Kong, but instead hit a straw decoy. Kong seized his opportunity, and grappled Yi to the ground.</p><p>Finally, Yi told Kong the truth. He and his fellow disciples had gone to defend Ionia during the war, bringing the wrath of Noxus down upon Wuju in turn. He blamed himself for the death of every last villager, and watched over the ruins as penance.</p><p>This, Kong realized, was what he sought. Although his tribe had cast him out, he wanted to defend the Shimon, who had sheltered him for so long, and set him on the path to wisdom and enlightenment. Proud of his student, Yi also felt a renewed sense of purpose\u2014he granted Kong an enchanted staff, crafted by the legendary weaponsmith Doran, and a new honorific, reserved only for the brightest students of Wuju.</p><p>From that day forward, he was known as Wukong.</p><p>Though the war is long over, Noxus\u2019 influence continues to defile Ionia. Roads have been carved through the ancient forests, self-styled \u201ctax collectors\u201d hound peaceful folk who have nothing left to give, and the great festivals of renewal have been slowly declining, year after year.</p><p>But the great warriors Wukong and Master Yi are ready. Side by side, they roam the First Lands, resolved to combat injustice and hatred wherever they find it.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>As a child of the Lhotlan tribe, Xayah loved listening to her father sing folk-hymns about ancient vastayan heroes. The haunting melodies transported her to a long-forgotten time, when magic danced freely through the island of Qaelin, imbuing the Lhotlan with immense power.</p><p>Yet with each new generation, humans encroached farther into all the vastaya\u2019s ancestral tribelands, disrupting their raw essence. The tribes began to fade, losing vitality as they were gradually cut off from the spirit of the First Lands, and were forced to negotiate with their mortal rivals.</p><p>Xayah watched in frustration as, time and again, her tribe\u2019s <i>juloah</i> ambassadors made treaties with mortals that were swiftly broken. Most disturbingly, humans had discovered the secrets of towering constructs known as quinlons, and were using them to inhibit Ionia\u2019s natural magic in order to protect their expanding settlements.</p><p>Even though Xayah and others like her urged their people to fight back, the Lhotlan instead withdrew into themselves, shunning the mortal world as they clung to what little they had left. Yet this would not protect them, and they were eventually driven from their homes.</p><p>The Lhotlan became rootless nomads. Xayah became a freedom fighter.</p><p>And she was not alone. Vastayan rebellions were growing across Ionia, seeking retribution against mortals. The time for negotiation was over. Xayah was determined to use her lethal quills in battle, to release the land\u2019s wild magic.</p><p>Flitting in and out of the most fortified strongholds and leaving a trail of bodies in her wake, she earned the sobriquet \u201cthe Violet Raven\u201d. Her dedication to the cause was unmatched, as she focused only on the next mission, and the next step toward freedom for her kind. Though she cherished her rebel allies, she usually acted alone, believing she could do the job better than any other.</p><p>But then she met another vastaya who would change her life forever.</p><p>After she entered the remote mountain town of Vlonqo in search of a stolen artifact, she was struck by the sight of a braying crowd of humans. Onstage before them stood a preening, flamboyant performer, who sang old vastayan songs for his captivated audience. As he finished his show with a dazzling array of cheap tricks, the crowd erupted and chanted his name: <i>Rakan! Rakan! Rakan!</i></p><p>He took a theatrical bow. Xayah dismissed him as a buffoon. A fellow Lhotlan he might be, but this Rakan seemed like nothing more than a foolish <i>mu\u2019takl.</i></p><p>Xayah willed herself to ignore him, and completed her mission... which she couldn\u2019t deny had become far easier thanks to Rakan distracting the locals.</p><p>Before Xayah could flee into the wilderness, Rakan accosted her. After making a series of failed attempts to charm her with flattery, the brash vastaya asked for news of the Lhotlan tribe. When she told him they had lost their lands, his plumage darkened, and she was surprised at the depth of his rage. Perhaps there was more to Rakan than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>When she told him of her true cause, he begged to join her. Seeing potential in his ability to create diversions, if nothing else, Xayah agreed.</p><p>When they began their travels, she saw Rakan as a useful\u2014but annoying\u2014asset. The showboating battle-dancer would leap and pirouette through enemies with ease, distracting them before Xayah struck them down. Indeed, this fighting style <i>almost</i> compensated for his irritating inability to remember Xayah\u2019s meticulous plans.</p><p>Rakan helped Xayah in other ways as well. While she was blunt and abrasive, he was insightful and charismatic, able to use charm and persuasion where she would have resorted to violence. She was impressed by his uncanny ability to assess people\u2019s emotions and trustworthiness. She sometimes questioned Rakan\u2019s compassion for mortals, but never doubted his devotion to the rebel cause.</p><p>Eventually, Xayah realized her feelings for Rakan were changing. There was a lightness to him and his free-spirited ways that she found aggravatingly alluring. Over time, she grew to welcome his company, and\u2014though she was initially loath to admit it\u2014the world didn\u2019t feel so broken and lonely. They became inseparable.</p><p>In all the years since, the two of them have become formidable champions of the vastaya, and word of their deeds is spreading. In the wake of the Noxian invasion, Ionians are undeniably more aggressive and dangerous\u2014especially the peoples of Navori, and the hated \u201cOrder of Shadow\u201d. Even so, this has enabled Xayah and Rakan to rally countless more vastaya to their side, and their dream of rebellion is coming to fruition.</p><p>Together, they will fight to reclaim the First Lands, so that the tribes may thrive once again.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Xerath is an Ascended Magus of ancient Shurima, a being of arcane energy writhing in the broken shards of a magical sarcophagus. For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.</p><p>The boy who would eventually be called Xerath was born a nameless slave in Shurima thousands of years ago. He was the son of captured scholars, with only the prospect of endless servitude ahead. His mother taught him letters and numbers, while his father told him tales from history in the hopes that such skills might allow him a better life. The boy vowed he would not end up bent-backed and whipped like every other slave.</p><p>When the boy\u2019s father was crippled during the excavations for the foundations of a monument to the Emperor\u2019s favorite horse, he was left to die at the site of the accident. Fearing her son would suffer a similar fate, the boy\u2019s mother begged an esteemed tomb architect to take him on as an apprentice. Though at first reluctant, the architect was impressed with the boy\u2019s eye for detail and innate understanding of mathematics and language, and accepted. The boy never saw his mother again.</p><p>He was a swift learner and his master dispatched him on errands to the Great Library of Nasus to retrieve specific texts and plans on an almost daily basis. On one trip, the boy met Azir, the least-favored son of the emperor. Azir was struggling to read a difficult passage in an ancient text, and, despite knowing that to talk to royalty was to invite death, the boy paused to help the young prince with its complex grammar. In that moment, a tentative friendship was established, and over the coming months that friendship only grew stronger.</p><p>Though slaves were forbidden names, Azir gave one to the boy. He named him Xerath, which means \u2018one who shares,\u2019 though that name was only ever spoken between the two boys. Azir saw to it that Xerath was appointed to his household\u2019s slaves, and made him his personal attendant. Their shared love of knowledge saw them devour texts from the library and become as close as brothers. Xerath was Azir\u2019s constant companion, learning all he could from this new proximity to culture, power and knowledge, finally daring to dream that Azir might one day free him.</p><p>On the annual tour of the emperor\u2019s dominion, assassins struck the royal caravan as it spent the night at a well-known oasis. Xerath saved Azir from an assassin\u2019s blade, but Azir\u2019s brothers were all slain, leaving the young prince a heartbeat away from Shurima\u2019s throne. As a slave, Xerath could expect no reward for his deed, but Azir promised that one day they would be as brothers. </p><p>In the wake of the assassination attempt, Shurima endured years of horror and fear of the emperor\u2019s retribution. Xerath knew enough of history and the workings of the Shuriman court to understand that Azir\u2019s life hung by the slenderest of threads. That he was heir to the throne meant nothing, for the emperor hated Azir for living while his more beloved sons had died. Of more immediate danger, the emperor\u2019s wife was still young enough to bear other children, and thus far she had borne many healthy sons. The odds were good that she would produce another male heir for her husband, and as soon as she did, Azir\u2019s life was forfeit.</p><p>Though Azir was a scholar at heart, Xerath persuaded him that to survive, he must also learn to fight. This Azir did, and in return the young heir elevated Xerath, insisting he continue his education. Both youths excelled, and Xerath proved to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, one who took to the pursuit of knowledge with gusto. Xerath became Azir\u2019s confidant and right hand man, a position unheard of for a mere slave. This position gave him great - and some said, undue - influence over the young prince, who came to rely on Xerath\u2019s judgement more each day.</p><p>Xerath bent his every effort into seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it, no matter the cost, no matter its source. He unlocked long-sealed libraries, delved into forgotten vaults and consulted with mystics entombed deep beneath the sands; all to further his knowledge and ambition, both of which grew with unchecked rapidity. Whenever the whispers around court that spoke of his delving into unsavory places grew too loud to ignore, he would find cunning means to silence them. That Azir never mentioned these whispers was, to Xerath, tacit approval of how he was keeping his emperor safe. </p><p>Years passed, and Xerath took ever darker steps to keep the emperor\u2019s wife from carrying a child to term, using his nascent magical abilities to corrupt every infant in the womb. Without rivals to the throne, Azir would be safe. When rumors of a curse arose, Xerath ensured they were never spoken again, and oft-times those who had voiced such suspicions vanished without trace. By now, Xerath\u2019s desire to escape his roots as a slave had become a burning ambition to achieve power of his own, though he justified every murderous act by telling himself he was doing it to keep his friend alive.</p><p>Despite Xerath\u2019s best efforts to thwart the queen\u2019s midwives, a new prince of Shurima was brought into the world, but on the night of his birth, Xerath used his growing magical powers to summon the elemental spirits of the deep desert and craft a terrible storm. Xerath brought bolt after bolt of lightning down upon the queen\u2019s chambers, reducing it to burning rubble and killing the queen and her newborn son. The emperor rushed to his queen\u2019s chambers, only to be confronted by Xerath, his hands ablaze with arcane power. The emperor\u2019s guards attacked, but Xerath burned them and the emperor to cindered skeletons. Xerath ensured that the mages of a conquered territory were blamed for these deaths, and Azir\u2019s first act upon taking the throne was to lead a brutal campaign of retribution against its people.</p><p>Azir was crowned emperor of Shurima with Xerath at his side, the boy who had once been a nameless slave. Xerath had long dreamed of this moment, and expected Azir to end slavery in Shurima before finally naming him brother. Azir did none of these things, continuing to expand his empire\u2019s borders and deflecting Xerath\u2019s overtures regarding the end of slavery. To Xerath, this was further proof of Shurima\u2019s moral bankruptcy, and he raged at Azir\u2019s breaking of his promise. Azir\u2019s face was thunderous as he reminded Xerath that he was a slave and should remember his place. Something once noble died in Xerath that day, but he bowed in supplication, outwardly accepting Azir\u2019s decision. As Azir continued his campaigns of conquest, Xerath remained at his side, but his every action was carefully designed to increase his influence over a realm he now planned to take for himself. To steal an empire was no small thing, and Xerath knew he needed more power.</p><p>The famous legend of Renekton\u2019s Ascension revealed that a mortal did not have to be chosen by the Sun Priests, that anyone could rise up. So Xerath plotted to steal the power of Ascension. No slave could ever stand upon the sun disc, so Xerath fed the Emperor\u2019s vanity, inflating his ego and filling his head with impossible visions of a world-spanning empire. But such a dream would only be possible if Azir could Ascend as the greatest heroes of Shurima had before. In time Xerath\u2019s perseverance paid off, and Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that he had earned the right to stand alongside Nasus and Renekton as an Ascended being. The Sun Priests protested, but such was Azir\u2019s hubris that he ordered them to comply on pain of torture and death.</p><p>The Day of Ascension arrived and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension with Xerath at his side. Nasus and Renekton were absent from the day\u2019s events, for Xerath had arranged a distraction for them by weakening the seal on a magical sarcophagus containing a beast of living fire. When that creature finally broke its bindings, Renekton and Nasus were the only warriors capable of defeating it. Thus Xerath had stripped Azir of the only two beings who might save him from what was to come.</p><p>Azir stood beneath the sun disc and in the final moment before the priests began the ritual, events took a turn Xerath had not anticipated. The emperor turned to Xerath and told him that he was now a free man. He and all Shurima\u2019s slaves were now released from their bonds of servitude. He embraced Xerath before naming him his eternal brother. Xerath was stunned. He had been given everything he desired, but the success of his plans hinged upon Azir\u2019s death and nothing was going to dissuade him from acting. Too many pieces were in motion and Xerath had already sacrificed too much to turn back now \u2013 no matter how much that part of him wanted to. The emperor\u2019s words pierced the bitterness enclosing Xerath\u2019s heart, but came decades too late. Unaware of his peril, Azir turned as the priests began the ritual and brought down the awesome power of the sun.</p><p>With a roar of anger and grief combined, Xerath blasted Azir from his place on the dais, watching through tears as his former friend burned to ash. Xerath took Azir\u2019s place and the light of the sun filled him, reshaping his flesh into that of an Ascended being. But the power of the ritual was not his to take, and the consequences of his betrayal of Azir were devastating. The unbound power of the sun all but destroyed Shurima, sundering its temples and bringing ruination upon the city. Azir\u2019s people were consumed in a terrifying conflagration as the desert rose up to claim the city. The sun disc fell and an empire built by generations of emperors was undone in a single day.</p><p>Even as the city burned, Xerath held the sun priests in the grip of his magic, preventing them from ending the ritual. The energies filling him were immense, alloying with his dark sorcery to create a being of incredible power. As he drew ever more of the sun\u2019s power into his body, his mortal flesh was consumed and remade as a glowing vortex of arcane power.</p><p>With Xerath\u2019s treachery revealed, Renekton and Nasus rushed to the epicenter of the magical storm destroying the city. They bore with them the magical sarcophagus that had imprisoned the spirit of eternal fire. The Ascended brothers fought their way to the Dais of Ascension just as Xerath fell from the deadly radiance engulfing the city. Before the newly-Ascended Magus could react, they hurled his crackling body within the sarcophagus and sealed it once more with blessed chains and powerful sigils of binding.</p><p>But it was not enough. Xerath\u2019s power had been great as a mortal, and that power - combined with the gift of Ascension - made him all but invincible. He shattered the sarcophagus, though its shards and chains remained bound to him. Renekton and Nasus hurled themselves at Xerath, but such was his newfound strength that he fought them both to a standstill. The battle raged throughout the collapsing city, destroying what had not already sunk beneath the sands. The brothers were able to drag Xerath toward the Tomb of Emperors, the greatest mausoleum of Shurima, a vault whose locks and wards were impossible to break and which answered only to the blood of emperors. Renekton wrestled Xerath within and called upon Nasus to seal the vault behind them. Nasus did so with heavy heart, knowing it was the only way to prevent Xerath\u2019s escape. Renekton and Xerath fell into eternal darkness, and there they remained, locked in an endless battle as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed.</p><p>Uncounted centuries passed and, in time, even Renekton\u2019s mighty strength waned, leaving him vulnerable to Xerath\u2019s influence. With poisoned lies and illusions, Xerath twisted Renekton\u2019s mind, filling him with misplaced bitterness toward Nasus, the faithless brother who had - in Xerath\u2019s fictive narrative - abandoned him so long ago.</p><p>When the Tomb of Emperors was finally discovered beneath the desert and broken open by Sivir and Cassiopeia, both Xerath and Renekton were freed in an explosion of sand and rubble. Sensing his brother still lived, Renekton charged from the ruins, his distorted mind leaving him little better than a savage beast. After an age lost to legend, Shurima was reborn, and as it rose majestically from the desert, Xerath felt another soul return to life beneath the sand, one he had thought long dead. Azir was also newly resurrected as one of the Ascended, and Xerath knew there could be no peace for either of them while the other yet lived.</p><p>Xerath sought the heart of the desert to regain his strength and understand how the world had changed in the millennia since his imprisonment. His stolen power grew with every passing moment, and he beheld a world ripe for conquest, a world brimming with mortals ready to worship at the feet of a new and terrible god. </p><p>Yet for all his newfound power, however far he has come from that nameless slave boy, a part of Xerath knows he is still in chains.</p>",

For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison.

                "lore_full": "<p>Rumored to have never lost in one-on-one combat, Xin Zhao spent much of his life fighting an uphill battle. Some of his earliest memories are of the <i>Viscero</i>, an Ionian fishing boat he served aboard off the coast of Raikkon. A diligent cabin boy, he obeyed his elders\u2019 every request\u2014from cleaning grimy decks to fixing tangled nets\u2014and enjoyed a peaceful existence\u2026 until the day they unknowingly ventured too deep into foreign waters.</p><p>A pair of privateer ships from Noxus chased down the smaller vessel. Their commander cited the glory of the empire as he boarded, claiming the <i>Viscero</i> and its crew as his rightful property. They were mostly ageing fishermen, unfit for military service, but they would be taken back to Noxian territory regardless.</p><p>After enduring a tough journey across the open ocean, Xin Zhao found himself in a strange new land. There was no delicate beauty in the waters here, no magic in the trees. Imposing gateways and fortified stone walls unlike anything he had ever seen lined the streets, and the people were crammed into every available inch of space. He learned this was the capital of Noxus, and it was from here that a man known as \u201cDarkwill\u201d ruled the vast empire. Separated from the rest of the <i>Viscero</i>\u2019s crew, and with no means of returning home, Xin Zhao entered the service of the man who had taken him prisoner.</p><p>His skill with a spear did not go unnoticed, and soon he was promised a better life\u2014with meals served on plates\u2014in exchange for his martial prowess. Noxus celebrated strength, and his patron deemed him to be a strong fighter.</p><p>Having nothing to lose, the young man accepted. He shed his ragged clothes for crude armor, and entered the Reckoning arenas.</p><p>Truly, this was a strange form of entertainment. Mighty warriors, known by even mightier titles, fought each other before ravenous crowds, who cheered for displays of skill and showmanship as often as they did for blood. Xin Zhao, taking the name \u201cViscero\u201d, was catapulted into success. His bouts soon filled the seats of every arena\u2026 and also the pockets of his sponsors. In only a few short years, Viscero became a celebrated name\u2014one that audiences adored, and other Reckoners came to fear.</p><p>But this good fortune did not last.</p><p>Beyond the distractions of the Reckoner circuit, the empire faced difficult times. Hostile nations encroached upon its territories, provoking rebellion all along the Noxian frontier. It was rumored that Darkwill and his advisors had offered a fortune in gold for the private release of mercenaries, prisoners, and Reckoners alike, to be conscripted into the empire\u2019s warhosts. With little more than a handshake, Xin Zhao and his fellows were bought out, and placed on a transport ship heading west.</p><p>Here, at the coastal fortress of Kalstead, the names and reputations of even the most well-known Reckoners counted for little. They were hurled into battle against the elite forces of King Jarvan III of Demacia, who was determined to curb Noxian influence on Valoran\u2026 and Xin Zhao quickly learned that war was unlike any arena duel.</p><p>While many of the former Reckoners deserted in the face of inevitable defeat, Xin Zhao held his ground, staining his spear with the blood of hundreds. When the king\u2019s Dauntless Vanguard\u2014some of whom were silently impressed by his skill\u2014finally surrounded him, still he refused to run. Xin Zhao stood tall, welcoming his execution.</p><p>However, Jarvan thought differently. Unlike the arena crowds, the king of Demacia took no pleasure in needless killing. He granted the defeated Noxians their freedom, if they would swear to leave Kalstead in peace. Surprised by this show of mercy, Xin Zhao thought about what awaited him back in Noxus. He could return to a society where his life had meant little beyond the gold he earned for his patrons\u2026 or he could fight for those who embodied the virtues to which he, himself, aspired.</p><p>Compelled by honor, he knelt before Jarvan III, pledging himself to the king\u2019s service.</p><p>In the decades that followed, Xin Zhao proved his loyalty time and again. As a seneschal of the royal household, he became bodyguard and advisor not only to his friend and master, but also to the king\u2019s son\u2014young Prince Jarvan, who would one day inherit the crown. Xin Zhao\u2019s path to becoming a Demacian may have been unusual, yet never once did he falter in his commitment to the kingdom and its ideals. This was not from a sense of duty, he reasoned, but by choice.</p><p>However, his greatest test came when a mage insurrection threatened the capital. With the nefarious Sylas of Dregbourne wreaking havoc throughout the Great City, Xin Zhao stood ready to defend his liege, but the king commanded him to leave on a personal mission of critical importance. With a heavy heart, Xin Zhao reluctantly obeyed.</p><p>It was only when the palace bells tolled that he knew the true gravity of his mistake. By the time the seneschal fought his way back, King Jarvan III was dead.</p><p>Xin Zhao believed his life would be forfeit\u2026 but instead, Prince Jarvan reminded him of the pledge he had once made, and accepted a renewal of his service to the kingdom.</p><p>For now, more than ever, Demacia <i>needs</i> its seneschal. The throne lies vacant, as the other noble houses fear that the prince may not yet be fit to rule. Xin Zhao has no such concerns\u2014he is utterly devoted to Jarvan, and determined to guide him in the perilous days to come.</p>",
                "lore_short": "Xin Zhao is a resolute warrior loyal to the royal family of Demacia. Once condemned to the fighting pits of Noxus, he survived countless gladiatorial bouts. It was not until he faced the forces of King Jarvan III in battle that he decided to relinquish his past life, in favor of serving what he saw as a more honorable cause. Armed with his favored three-talon spear, Xin Zhao now fights for his adopted kingdom, audaciously challenging any foe, no matter the odds.",

                "lore_full": "<p>As a child, Yasuo often believed what the others in his village said of him: on the best days, his very existence was an error in judgement; on the worst, he was a mistake that could never be undone.</p><p>Like most pain, there was some truth to it. His mother was a widow already raising a young son, when the man who would be Yasuo\u2019s father blew into her life like an autumn wind. And, just like that lonely season, he was gone again before the blanket of Ionian winter settled over the small family.</p><p>Even though Yasuo\u2019s older half-brother, Yone, was everything Yasuo was not\u2014respectful, cautious, conscientious\u2014the two were inseparable. When other children teased Yasuo, Yone was there to defend him. But what Yasuo lacked in patience, he made up for in determination. When Yone began his apprenticeship at the village\u2019s renowned sword school, a young Yasuo followed, waiting outside in monsoon rain, until the teachers relented and opened the gates.</p><p>Much to the annoyance of his new peers, Yasuo showed natural talent, and became the only student to catch the attention of Elder Souma, last master of the legendary wind technique. The old man saw Yasuo\u2019s potential, but the impulsive pupil refused his tutelage, remaining unbridled like a whirlwind. Yone pleaded with his brother to set aside his arrogance, gifting him a maple seed, the school\u2019s highest lesson in humility. The next morning, Yasuo accepted the position as Souma\u2019s apprentice, and personal bodyguard.</p><p>When word of the Noxian invasion reached the school, some were inspired by the great stand that had been taken at the Placidium of Navori, and soon the village was bled of the able bodied. Yasuo longed to add his sword to the cause, but even as his classmates and brother left to fight, he was ordered to remain and protect the elders.</p><p>The invasion became a war. Finally, one rain-slicked night, the drums of a Noxian march could be heard in the next valley over. Yasuo abandoned his post, foolishly believing he could turn the tide.</p><p>But he found no battle\u2014only a raw grave for hundreds of Noxian and Ionian corpses. Something terrible and unnatural had happened here, something that no single blade could have stopped. The land itself seemed tainted by it.</p><p>Sobered, Yasuo returned to the school the next day, only to be surrounded by the remaining students, their swords drawn. Elder Souma was dead, and Yasuo found himself accused not only of dereliction, but of murder. He realized the true killer would go unpunished if he did not act quickly, so he fought his way free, though he knew this would all but confirm his apparent guilt.</p><p>Now a fugitive in war-torn Ionia, Yasuo sought any clue that might lead him to the murderer. All the while, he was hunted by his former allies, continually forced to fight or die. This was a price he was willing to pay, until he was tracked down by the one he dreaded most\u2014his own brother, Yone.</p><p>Bound by honor, they circled each other. When their swords finally met, Yasuo\u2019s wind magic overcame Yone\u2019s dual blades, and with a single flash of steel, the outcast cut his brother down.</p><p>He begged forgiveness, but Yone\u2019s dying words were of the wind techniques responsible for Elder Souma\u2019s death, and that his brother was the only one who could have known them. Then he fell silent, passing on before he could grant any absolution.</p><p>Without master or brother, Yasuo roamed the mountains distraught, drinking away the pain of war and loss, a sword without a sheath. There in the snow, he met Taliyah, a young Shuriman stone mage who had fled the Noxian military. In her, Yasuo saw an unlikely student, and in himself, an even more unlikely teacher. He trained her in the ways of elemental magic, wind shaping stone, embracing at last the teachings of Elder Souma.</p><p>Their world changed with rumors of a risen Shuriman god-emperor. Yasuo and Taliyah parted ways, though he gifted her the treasured maple seed, its lesson now learned. As she returned to her native desert sands, Yasuo set out for his own village, determined to put right his mistakes and find his old master\u2019s true killer.</p><p>Within the stone walls of the council hall, Elder Souma\u2019s death was revealed to have been an accident, one brought about by the Noxian exile known as Riven\u2014and one for which she felt deep remorse. Even so, Yasuo still could not absolve himself of the choice he had made to abandon his master or, worse yet, how that choice had ultimately led to Yone\u2019s death.</p><p>Yasuo eventually journeyed to the spirit blossom festival in Weh\u2019le, though he held little hope that its healing rituals would ease his heart. It was there he encountered a demonic creature that sought to devour him, an <i>azakana</i> that fed on his pain and regret.</p><p>Yet a masked intruder intervened, striking down the creature with righteous fury, and Yasuo realized he knew this man\u2014it was <i>Yone</i>.</p><p>Fully expecting his brother to take vengeance, Yasuo was surprised when Yone let him go with little more than a bitter blessing.</p><p>With nothing left for him in the First Lands, Yasuo has embarked on a new adventure, though he knows not where it will lead, his sense of guilt the only thing weighing down the free wind.</p>",

In time, his master\u2019s true killer was revealed, and his brother mysteriously returned from death, yet Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done. Now, he wanders the world with only the wind to guide his blade.",

Even as a child, his love for his family led him to assume the mantle of protector, motivated in no small way by the loss of his father. This was in stark contrast to his half-brother, Yasuo, who was brash and reckless where Yone was patient and disciplined.</p><p>Still, the two were inseparable\u2014and when Yone began his studies at the renowned sword school near their village, Yasuo followed.</p><p>As they trained, Yone was often forced to temper his younger brother\u2019s impulsiveness. However, when Yasuo refused the personal tutelage of Elder Souma, master of the legendary wind technique, Yone gifted him a maple seed\u2014a symbol of humility\u2014as a sign of his support and encouragement.</p><p>Yone was proud of his brother, but he had doubts about the wise master\u2019s judgment, fearing that Yasuo\u2019s impulsive nature would make him a poor student. But Elder Souma was well respected, and did not make careless decisions.</p><p>Putting his concerns aside, Yone continued to practice with dual blades, his prowess quickly earning the respect and admiration of his fellow disciples. Though Yone\u2019s skill was unmatched, Yasuo\u2019s use of the wind technique made their sparring sessions a sight to behold, and a joy to the brothers themselves.</p><p>But that joy did not last long. War came to Ionia.</p><p>Yone, along with many other disciples, left to defend against the approaching Noxian forces while Yasuo reluctantly stayed behind to protect his master. But one fateful night, Elder Souma was discovered dead\u2014slain by the very wind technique that he taught.</p><p>When Yone returned, he found that Yasuo had fled.</p><p>This shook Yone to his core. His fears were proven true\u2014Elder Souma had been wrong.</p><p>Yone blamed himself. If Yasuo <i>had</i> murdered Souma, Yone had failed to teach him the righteous path. If Yasuo had simply abandoned his post and allowed his master to die, then Yone had failed to instill him with discipline. Either way, Yasuo had already killed several of those who pursued him\u2014and to Yone, their blood stained his own hands as much as his brother\u2019s.</p><p>He tracked Yasuo down. When their swords finally crossed, Yone\u2019s steel was unmatched\u2026 but Yasuo\u2019s mastery of the wind cut his brother down.</p><p>Death, however, was not the end. When Yone awoke within the spirit realm, the weight of his failure crushed him. His fury flared, and he pounded his fists on the ground in rage.</p><p>A rumbling laugh pierced his thoughts. He turned, and beheld a monstrous, humanoid spirit with a blood-red blade. It was a powerful <i>azakana</i>, a predatory entity that had long stalked Yone from beyond the veil.</p><p>Before Yone could speak, it struck.</p><p>He drew the spiritual echoes of his blades to his side just in time to block the attack. He once again found himself in a duel where his swordsmanship was unparalleled, but he was overwhelmed by magic.</p><p>Anger consumed him. A lifetime of honor and duty snapped. In one furious moment, Yone wrested the azakana\u2019s blade from it and ran the creature through.</p><p>The last thing he heard before a new darkness took him was that same rumbling laughter\u2026</p><p>As he came to, Yone found himself back in the material realm, though it was a grim shadow of what it had been. He struggled to his feet, the spirit realm hazy in his mind, and a blood-red sword in his hand. Upon his head, a mask had coalesced in the form of the azakana\u2019s face\u2014he could not remove it, but he could now see <i>other</i> azakana through its eyes. They were not yet true demons, content to feed on negativity before eventually manifesting to devour their hosts. But, as Yone would discover, if an azakana\u2019s name was learned, they could be reduced to inert masks of personified emotion.</p><p>Even so, he could not tell if\u2014or when\u2014the azakana he wore would reawaken to consume him. In life, Yone had worn the mask of <i>protector</i>, <i>brother</i>, and <i>disciple</i> for so long that it had become his identity. But now, in moments of stillness, he swears he can feel the mask shifting upon his face, his own past and unresolved conflict with Yasuo now paling in comparison to this new threat.</p><p>Yone hunts these insidious creatures in an attempt to understand what he has become\u2014with each name bringing him a step closer to uncovering that of the one whose laughter still haunts him.</p><p>Nothing else matters. There is only the chase of truth.</p>",

Trapped on the Shadow Isles, his only companions are the rotting corpses and shrieking spirits that he gathers to him. Yorick\u2019s monstrous actions belie his noble purpose: to free his home from the curse of the Ruination.</p><p>Even as a child, Yorick\u2019s life was never normal. Raised in a fishing village at the very edge of the Blessed Isles, he always struggled to find acceptance. While most children his age were playing hide-and-seek, young Yorick was making friends of a different kind\u2014the spirits of the recently deceased.</p><p>At first, Yorick was terrified of his ability to see and hear the dead. Whenever someone in the village passed away, Yorick would lie awake all night, waiting for the chilling cry of a new visitor. He could not understand why they chose to haunt him, and why his parents believed the spirits to be nothing more than nightmares.</p><p>In time, he came to realize the souls were not there to harm him. They were simply lost and needed help finding their way to the beyond. Since only Yorick was able to see these spirits, he took it upon himself to be their guide, escorting them to whatever awaited in eternity.</p><p>The task was bittersweet. Yorick found that he enjoyed the company of ghosts, but each one he brought to rest meant saying farewell to another friend. To the dead, he was a savior, but to the living, he was a pariah. The villagers only saw a disturbed little boy who spoke to people who weren\u2019t there.</p><p>Tales of Yorick\u2019s visions soon spread beyond his village, and drew the attention of a small order of monks who dwelled at the heart of the Blessed Isles. Its envoys traveled to Yorick\u2019s island, believing he could become an asset to their faith.</p><p>Yorick agreed to journey to their monastery, and there, he learned the ways of the Brethren of the Dusk and the true significance of their trappings. Every monk carried a spade as a symbol of their duty to conduct proper burial rites, which ensured souls would not lose their way. And each brother wore a vial of water drawn from the Blessed Isles\u2019 sacred spring. These Tears of Life represented the monks\u2019 duty to heal the living.</p><p>Yet, no matter how he tried, Yorick could never gain the acceptance of the other monks. To them, he was tangible proof of things that should only be known through faith. They resented his power to easily perceive what they themselves had struggled their entire lives to understand.  Shunned by his brothers, Yorick found himself alone again.</p><p>One morning, as he tended to his duties in the cemetery,  Yorick was interrupted by the sight of a pitch-black cloud roiling across the surface of the Blessed Isles, devouring everything in its path. Yorick tried to run, but the cloud quickly enveloped him and plunged him into shadow.</p><p>All around Yorick, living things began to writhe and contort, corrupted by the foul magic in the Black Mist. People, animals, even plants began to transform into vile, ghoulish mockeries of their former selves. Whispers emanated from the turbulent air around him, and his brothers began ripping the vials of healing water from their necks, as if the objects were causing them great anguish. A moment later, Yorick watched in abject horror as the monks\u2019 souls were ripped from their bodies, leaving cold, pale corpses behind.</p><p>Among the quieting screams of his brethren, Yorick alone could hear voices within the mist.</p><p>\u201cRemove it. Join us. We will become one.\u201d</p><p>He felt his fingers grasping for the vial at his neck. Mustering all his resolve, Yorick forced his hands away from his throat and commanded the howling souls to stop. The Black Mist writhed violently, and darkness overtook him.</p><p>When Yorick awoke, the winds had calmed, and the once-fertile lands had transformed into the grotesque hellscape of the Shadow Isles. Isolated tendrils of the Black Mist clung to him, trying to overtake the one living thing not yet corrupted. As the Mist wrapped itself around him, Yorick saw it suddenly recoil from the vial at his neck. Yorick clutched the blessed water, realizing it was all that kept him alive.</p><p>In the days that followed, Yorick scoured the islands for survivors, but found only the twisted remnants of what once lived there. Everywhere he walked, he witnessed wretched spirits rising from the bodies of the dead.</p><p>As he searched, Yorick slowly pieced together the events that led to the cataclysm: A king had arrived seeking to resurrect his queen, but instead, had doomed the Isles and everything on them.</p><p>Yorick wished to find this \u201cRuined King\u201d and undo the curse he had unleashed. But he felt powerless in the face of the seemingly endless death that surrounded him.</p><p>Almost lost within his grief, Yorick began to speak to the spirits around him, attempting to find solace with them as he had as a child. Instead, as he communed with the Mist, corpses left their graves, guided by his voice. He realized the bodies he once laid to rest were now his to command.</p><p>A glimmer of hope shone from the heart of his despair. To free the dead of the Shadow Isles, Yorick would wield their power and their strength.</p><p>In order to end the curse, he would be forced to use it.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>In the outlands of Bandle City, there was once a wooded glen where the moon-moths glimmered and the riverbanks overflowed with rainbowfish. In a cottage nestled between the verdant trees lived a yordle enchantress named Norra, with her cat, Yuumi.</p><p>Born with magical powers of protection, Yuumi enjoyed a life of leisure for many years, pouncing on sunbeams and napping beneath the mouse-trees. Whenever adventure sparked her interest, she joined Norra on explorations across the material and spirit realms. Norra spent her time collecting strange objects like broken cups, shards of colored glass, and fabric with funny stitching. She examined each artifact with deep reverence, though Yuumi never understood their purpose. Nevertheless, Yuumi would use her magic to protect Norra from harm, and would warm her feet when they returned home.</p><p>The doorways between realms are finicky and seldom open, even to creatures as dexterous as cats. Yuumi watched as other yordles waited for days for the eastern star to align with a particular stone archway, or waded impatiently between marsh-lilies, seeking a silver blossom blooming from the mud\u2014only then would a pathway appear. But Yuumi\u2019s yordle, Norra, possessed the powerful Book of Thresholds, which allowed her to instantly travel anywhere depicted in its pages. When Norra opened a portal, she and Yuumi would gleefully dive into its glowing paper and arrive at their destination, joined a moment later by the book.</p><p>Yuumi never paid the book much attention until one starless night, when she returned home from luring moon-moths with her shinylight to find Norra missing. She saw the book on her master\u2019s desk and flipped through its pages in a panic, noticing that some were torn out entirely. Unable to read its title, Yuumi cried out to it in distress, calling it, simply, \u201cBook\u201d. In response, the book wiggled, and Yuumi was surprised to learn she could understand thoughts amidst the rustling paper. Despite not having a voice, Book made itself loud and clear. Yuumi learned that Norra had gone somewhere so perilous, she had destroyed the portal as she traveled.</p><p>Yuumi knew she had to rescue Norra, and turned to Book for help. Each of its thousand pages led to a different location along the lines of magic that crossed the material and spirit realms. The page Norra had used to travel was lost, but Book might be able to get them close. Yuumi and Book would have to explore every possible threshold. She became Book\u2019s unlikely Keeper, vowing to protect it with the courage of a lion\u2014if it fell into the wrong hands, the doorways to Bandle City could open to all kinds of unsavory and ravenous intruders.</p><p>Yuumi and Book began their arduous journey, visiting dangerous and unfamiliar lands. Yuumi sought Norra\u2019s scent on the wind, to little avail. While Yuumi would sometimes break from their search to follow the scent of a mouse or restore her strength with a quick catnap, Book was frustratingly cautious, grumpy over lost time and nervous about threats they might encounter. Nevertheless, Yuumi and Book were both determined to find their master and bring her home.</p><p>When Yuumi especially missed Norra, she often sought out other companions. One of her favorites was a door-carrying shepherd with thick whiskers and a deep laugh like a babbling brook. Yuumi rested on his shoulders for a time, protecting him from angry snow-spirits stirring up flurries in a hailstorm, while he brought her wriggling fish.</p><p>Eventually, Yuumi uncovered the scent of her master lingering in a vast Shuriman ruin. Digging deep into the sand, she unearthed a broken shard of blue pottery that looked like a piece from one of Norra\u2019s teapots. Before she could burrow further, a ferocious beast surfaced from the sand, and Yuumi and Book barely escaped. She could only imagine the chaos if a creature like that ripped its claws into Book\u2019s pages.</p><p>Though unlikely companions, Yuumi and Book have become fast friends, united by their love for Norra. Yuumi continues to search everywhere for signs of her master, so she can someday return to her life of napping in the sun by Norra\u2019s side.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Zac is the product of a toxic spill that ran through a chemtech seam and pooled in an isolated cavern deep in Zaun\u2019s Sump. Despite such humble origins, Zac has grown from primordial ooze into a thinking being who dwells in the city\u2019s pipes, occasionally emerging to help those who cannot help themselves or to rebuild the broken infrastructure of Zaun.</p><p>A group of Zaunite children first encountered Zac when they were out skimming rocks over a sump pool and some of the stones were thrown back. The \u201cReturning Pool\u201d became well-known to Zaun\u2019s Sump dwellers, and eventually drew the attention of a shadowy cabal of chemtech alchymists. Over the protests of the local residents, the alchymists pumped the contents of the pool into vats and carried the substance back to their laboratories for experimentation.</p><p>Via a series of experiments designed to test negative and positive reinforcement techniques, the alchymists discovered the coagulate mass within the pool appeared to have psychotropic tendencies. Simply put, it mirrored whatever stimulus was provided to it. If treated well, it responded with childlike glee and playfulness, but when its response to pain and aggression were tested, the alchymists lost numerous augmented sump-scrappers in the ensuing destruction.</p><p>Most of the alchymists attributed this to nothing more than a simple reflex response, but two among their number weren\u2019t so sure. They questioned the morality of experiments that seemed entirely driven to produce a creature of unmatched aggression. When the pair dug further, they discovered the project was being funded by Saito Takeda, a Chem-Baron with a notoriously violent temperament and reputation for bloody gang warfare. The implication was clear; Takeda sought to develop a fighter who could shrug off mortal wounds, squeeze into places humans could not and who would obey any command. They also discovered the project\u2019s true name; the Zaun Amorphous Combatant.</p><p>As they pondered the best course of action, the two dissenting alchymists saw more than just a mirroring of whatever stimulus was applied to the viscous gel. They saw behaviors manifest without any obvious stimulus - behaviors consistent with sentience. They came to know the creature as Zac and concluded that he exhibited the behaviors of a thinking, feeling being. They brought their findings to the spindle-limbed leader of their research team, but their concerns were ignored.</p><p>Unwilling to let the matter drop, they began their own covert efforts to counter the violent teachings of the rest of their team. They sought to show Zac right from wrong, exposing him to acts of altruism and generosity. Their efforts bore fruit, with Zac showing sadness when one of the researchers hurt her hand and reacting badly when another killed a rat in the laboratory. Eventually, they could no longer tolerate the cruel experiments being done to Zac by their fellow alchymists.</p><p>One night, during Zaun\u2019s Progress Day remembrances, when the laboratory was empty, they drained Zac into a wheeled septic tank and dragged him to a far distant part of Zaun. When their act was later discovered, the footsoldiers of Baron Takeda sought them out. But Zaun is a big place, and the researchers were able to hide from their pursuers. They had thought to give Zac his freedom, but Zac did not want to be released, for he now considered the two researchers his family. They alone had shown him kindness, and he wanted to learn more from them. In truth, they were pleased by his reaction, for they had become so fond of Zac that they considered him their adoptive son.</p><p>To stay hidden from Takeda\u2019s men, they changed their identities and appearance, taking up residence in a remote part of the Sump, far from prying eyes. Zac learned to mimic their voices, and quickly adapted to shift his gelatinous mass into the required shapes to form sound. He lived alongside his adoptive parents for many years, hiding when necessary in sump pools or in the cracks in the cliffside rocks. His \u2018parents\u2019 told Zac of the world in which he lived, how it could be beautiful and full of wonder. They showed him the moon rise over the Sun Gates, the play of rainbow light on the stained glass roofs of Zaun\u2019s commercia halls, and the bustling, vibrant beauty of their city\u2019s heart. They also explained how the world could be cruel and harsh, and Zac learned that people were sometimes mean and unkind, hateful and prejudiced. Zac rejected such behaviors and helped his parents where he could as they used their skills to aid the people around them without attracting undue attention.</p><p>They did what they could to treat the sick, mend broken machinery or otherwise put their chem-knowledge to benign use. These were golden years for Zac, and he roamed Zaun through its almost limitless network of pipes and through the many cracks in its bedrock. As much as Zac was a sentient being, too much stimulus from his environment could sometimes overwhelm his senses and cause him to temporarily absorb the dominant emotions around him, for good or ill. Oft-times he couldn\u2019t help getting involved in aiding the oppressed and downtrodden against thuggish bullies; leading to rumors of his presence spreading through Zaun. Though the majority of tales were of him helping, others attributed destructive events to Zac; a factory destroyed or a crevasse ripping open in a Sump neighborhood. </p><p>Eventually, those rumors reached the ears of Saito Takeda, and he sent a band of augmented thugs to retrieve what he saw as his property. His alchymists had been attempting - without success - to replicate the process that had created Zac from droplets left behind in his vat. Takeda wanted the creature returned, and his augmented heavies surrounded Zac\u2019s parents\u2019 home and attacked. They fought back, for they were chemtech researchers and not without esoteric means of defending themselves, but their defiance could not last forever and eventually they were killed, despite Takeda\u2019s order that they be taken alive.</p><p>Zac had been exploring subterranean seams far below Zaun, but sensed his parents\u2019 distress and raced back through the pipes of the city to the rescue. He arrived too late to save them, and the fury that overwhelmed him upon seeing their bodies was unmatched by anything the baron\u2019s men had ever seen. Zac attacked in a ferocious display of stretching, smashing, and crushing. In his grief and anger, he demolished dozens of nearby dwellings, and by the time the battle was over, all the augmented thugs were dead.</p><p>When the heightened emotions of battle drained from Zac\u2019s consciousness, he was overcome with remorse for the homes he had destroyed, and vowed to continue the good work done by his parents. He helped rebuild what he had destroyed, but as soon as the work was done, he vanished into Zaun\u2019s vast network of pipes.</p><p>Now Zac lives alone, dwelling in the tunnels and caverns threading Zaun, and bathing in the emotions of the city\u2019s inhabitants. Sometimes this enriches him, but other times it saddens him as he takes on both the good and bad of the city. He has become something of an urban legend among the people of Zaun, a mysterious creature that sometimes emerges from cracks in the rock or a section of damaged pipework. Most times this is to help those in need, but in times of trouble, when the city\u2019s moods turn grim, his appearance can be cause for trepidation.</p>",

For Zed, his story began as a boy on the cold steps of the home of the Kinkou Order.</p><p>Taken in by Great Master Kusho himself, Zed found his place within the temple\u2019s ancient walls. He dedicated himself to understanding the Kinkou\u2019s spiritual tenets, quickly outpacing his peers both in combat and study. Even so, he felt overshadowed by another\u2014his master\u2019s son, Shen. Though Zed\u2019s passion shone through in every technique he perfected, he lacked Shen\u2019s emotional balance. In spite of this, the two pupils became like brothers.</p><p>In time, they journeyed together with their master to track down the infamous Golden Demon. When they finally succeeded in capturing this feared \u201cmonster,\u201d it was revealed to be a mere man named Khada Jhin. The young Zed marched forward with his blades held high, but Kusho stopped him, ordering that Jhin be imprisoned instead.</p><p>Returning to their temple, Zed\u2019s heart bloomed with resentment, and he began to struggle in his studies. He was haunted by the memories of Jhin\u2019s grisly murders, and rising tensions between Ionia and the imperialistic forces of Noxus only worsened his disillusionment. While Shen was growing to adopt his father\u2019s dispassion, Zed refused to let lofty notions of balance stand in the way of punishing evil.</p><p>He ventured deep into the temple\u2019s hidden catacombs, and there he discovered an ornate, black box. Even though he knew it was forbidden to any but the masters of the order, he peered inside.</p><p>Shadows enveloped Zed\u2019s mind, feeding his bitterness with contempt for the weak, and hinting at an ancient, dark magic.</p><p>Returning to the light of the temple, he came face to face with Great Master Kusho. Zed demanded the Kinkou strike at the Noxian invaders with every means at their disposal. When Kusho refused, Zed turned his back on the order that had raised him.</p><p>Unbound by Kinkou doctrine, he raised a following of warriors to resist Noxus. Any soul who threatened his homeland, or stood idle in its defense, was marked for death without mercy\u2014including native vastaya who wavered in their allegiance. Zed urged his followers to embrace the fervor of war, but soon enough he realized his own abilities would never match his ambitions without the black box.</p><p>Amassing his new acolytes, he returned to the Kinkou temple, where he was met by Kusho. The elderly man laid his weapons at Zed\u2019s feet, imploring his former pupil to renounce the shadows in favor of a more balanced path.</p><p>Moments later, Zed emerged back onto the temple steps. In one hand, he grasped the box\u2014and in the other, his freshly bloodied blade.</p><p>The Kinkou, frozen with shock, fell in droves as Zed\u2019s warriors cut them down. He then claimed the temple for himself, establishing his Order of Shadow, and began training his acolytes in the ways of darkness. They etched their flesh with shadowy tattoos, learning to fight alongside shrouded reflections of themselves.</p><p>Zed took advantage of the ongoing war with Noxus, and the suffering it brought to the Ionian people. In the wake of a massacre near the Epool River, he came upon Kayn, a Noxian child soldier wielding nothing but a farmer\u2019s sickle. Zed could see the boy was a weapon waiting to be sharpened, and took him as his personal student. In this young acolyte, he saw a purity of purpose to match his own. In Kayn, Zed could see the future of the Order of Shadow.</p><p>Though he did not reconcile with Shen and the remaining Kinkou, now scattered throughout the provinces, they reached an uneasy accord in the aftermath of the war. Zed knew what he had done could not be undone.</p><p>In recent years, it has become clear that the balance of the First Lands has been disrupted, perhaps forever. For Zed, spiritual harmony holds little consequence\u2014he will do what needs to be done to see Ionia triumph.<br></p>",

During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow form\u2014a malevolent spirit magic as dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>Raised in a large working-class family, Zeri grew up surrounded by warmth, care, and many strong opinions. They were no strangers to hardship, having lost loved ones to Zaun\u2019s dangers. Even so, their community was their strength.</p>\n<p>From birth, Zeri had a unique relationship with electricity. Each giggle caught a spark\u2014each cry, a shock. Magic wasn\u2019t rare in Zaun, but Zeri\u2019s electric charm was. It charged with her emotions, sometimes grounded, sometimes building to fierce and fiery. By her teenage years, her neighbors knew she was more likely the cause of power outages than a broken circuit. Life in Zaun was beautiful chaos, her grandma would say, and Zeri embodied that all too well.</p>\n<p>Not everyone found her quirks endearing. To family and friends, Zeri was a lovable mess. To others, she was simply... a mess. During occasional outbursts where her stray currents shattered a street lamp or two (or twelve), Zeri thought she'd even see flashes of something\u2014or someone\u2014but there was no time to dwell. She wished she had better control of her volatile powers. Her determination was there, but her patience could have used some work.</p>\n<p>Still, with every spark came an opportunity.</p>\n<p>One night while Zeri strolled through the Entresol markets, the ground rattled from underground excavations that soon swelled into a destructive quake. She wasted no time zooming past fallen buildings to rescue trapped victims. As her world slowly crumbled, Zeri became a furious blur. She knew the chem-barons had mining facilities nearby that were installed after they'd claimed to have discovered resources better than hextech, but what they did not reveal were the risks of their uncontrolled digging.</p>\n<p>The faster Zeri moved, the more charged she became. She thrived under pressure, realizing what her powers could do and how much her neighborhood meant to her\u2014even if it meant nothing to the barons.</p>\n<p>After the dust settled, survivors gathered to thank Zeri. Beneath her relief was anger. Zeri knew she could\u2019ve saved more if she had better command of herself.</p>\n<p>What Zeri <em>did</em> accomplish was sure to catch the attention of the barons. She knew they wouldn\u2019t think twice about who they went through to get to her, and she couldn\u2019t risk others getting hurt. Not again. To guard them from herself, Zeri scoured the mining disaster\u2019s wreckage and constructed a jacket to contain her electricity and avert the barons\u2019 gaze. Now she could restrain her gift to protect those in need.</p>\n<p>Walking the damaged streets, Zeri saw broken faces. Families scrambled to rebuild, and Zeri lent her hand, doing all she could without her powers. But the more she helped, the more she witnessed. Workers struggled to jumpstart generators. Parents toiled to make meals with broken stovetops. These people didn\u2019t have anyone standing up for them, let alone someone with a gift like hers. She knew her district\u2014and those like it\u2014would never truly be safe if things stayed the way they were. The barons saw them as nothing more than objects to be neglected and resources to be bled.</p>\n<p>Zeri knew what had to be done. She couldn\u2019t wait for the next mining \u201caccident.\u201d She had to take the fight to the barons.</p>\n<p>Zeri was a one-woman force, sending shockwaves through Zaun. Word spread of chem-baron supply lines being destroyed, with reports of \u201clightning\u201d striking faster than the eye could see. Enraged at their losses, the local barons formed a rare alliance, and their combined power trounced Zeri wherever she went. She tried to adapt\u2014to strike faster\u2014but against the barons\u2019 endless resources, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>She retreated with her body broken and her powers fizzling. The barons were united. She was alone.</p>\n<p>As she headed home, Zeri expected disappointment from those she let down. But what welcomed her was family, friends, and people she\u2019d never met, all standing up to fight their oppressors. From their rebuilt homes came rediscovered courage. Zeri had never felt so inspired, yet it was she who had inspired them. She was the spark that ignited their fire.</p>\n<p>And she was no longer alone. With the help of their neighbors, Zeri\u2019s mother had fashioned her a rifle made of materials given by those Zeri fought for: The people of the Entresol. The gun\u2019s ammo was Zeri\u2019s emotions, its conductive barrel amplifying her powers directly from her hands. Paired with her jacket, she could better control her voltage, charging up to shoot precise\u2014or, at least, somewhat precise\u2014electric bursts. Zeri gazed warmly at her family and her neighbors. She thought she\u2019d lose them all in her efforts to fight back, but because she stood up for them, they stood up with her.</p>\n<p>Backed by her community, Zeri fights for those who cannot. Zaun is not perfect, and neither is Zeri, but sometimes a spark is all it takes to change the world.</p>",
                "lore_short": "<p>A headstrong, spirited young woman from Zaun\u2019s working-class, Zeri channels her electric magic to charge herself and her custom-crafted gun. Her volatile power mirrors her emotions, its sparks reflecting her lightning-fast approach to life. Deeply compassionate toward others, Zeri carries the love of her family and her home into every fight. Though her eagerness to help can sometimes backfire, Zeri believes one truth to be certain: stand up for your community, and it will stand up with you.</p>",

Aspiring to be a revered inventor like Heimerdinger, he rattled through ambitious projects with manic zeal, emboldened by both his explosive failures and his unprecedented discoveries. Word of Ziggs&apos; volatile experimentation reached the famed Yordle Academy in Piltover and its esteemed professors invited him to demonstrate his craft. His characteristic disregard for safety brought the presentation to an early conclusion, however, when the hextech engine Ziggs was demonstrating overheated and exploded, blowing a huge hole in the wall of the Academy. The professors dusted themselves off and sternly motioned for him to leave. Devastated, Ziggs prepared to return to Bandle City in shame. However, before he could leave, a group of Zaunite agents infiltrated the Academy and kidnapped the professors. The Piltover military tracked the captives to a Zaunite prison, but their weapons were incapable of destroying the fortified walls. Determined to outdo them, Ziggs began experimenting on a new kind of armament, and quickly realized that he could harness his accidental gift for demolition to save the captured yordles.</p><p>Before long, Ziggs had created a line of powerful bombs he lovingly dubbed &apos;&apos;hexplosives.&apos;&apos; With his new creations ready for their first trial, Ziggs traveled to Zaun and sneaked into the prison compound. He launched a gigantic bomb at the prison and watched with glee as the explosion tore through the reinforced wall. Once the smoke had cleared, Ziggs scuttled into the facility, sending guards running with a hail of bombs. He rushed to the cell, blew the door off its hinges, and led the captive yordles to freedom. Upon returning to the Academy, the humbled professors recognized Ziggs with an honorary title - Dean of Demolitions. Vindicated at last, Ziggs accepted the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to greater Valoran.</p>",

As the Shuriman empire expanded across the continent, Axamuk\u2019s calls for peaceful coexistence were ignored, and his armies destroyed by the god-warriors of the Ascended Host.</p><p>Though humbled by this defeat, many Icathians saw an opportunity for mutual advancement. Accepting an offer of autonomous satrapy, they installed a governing council of distinguished mages, philosophers, and lawmakers to oversee the transition of power.</p><p>After almost nine centuries of imperial rule, a young man named Zilean joined the council\u2019s ranks. He was an elemental mage with a prodigious understanding of physical reality, who had studied under the greatest minds of the age\u2014from the great Yun of Ixtal, to the astromancers of Faraj, and countless others besides.</p><p>There was one component of the material realm that few had ever truly grasped, but Zilean was determined to master.</p><p><i>Time.</i></p><p>Time was the one inescapable constant, in all things. Even the mighty god-warriors were not immune to its passage\u2026 though they were revered above all others in Shuriman culture.</p><p>As part of the political establishment, Zilean now saw more clearly the smoldering discontent among the citizens of Icathia. While their land was home to some of the most heroic leaders and revolutionary thinkers in the empire, not one had ever been deemed worthy of Ascension. Again and again, the council submitted petitions to the distant emperor, yet access to the Sun Disc was denied, without explanation. For all they gave, it seemed Icathians would never be seen as equals.</p><p>Zilean\u2019s own resentment grew, yet he was worried by open talk of secession among his peers. He was a patriot through and through, but in the face of the Ascended Host, any rebellion could only end in calamity for his people. Seeking a diplomatic solution, he went as an envoy to neighboring Kahleek, Kalduga, and Ixtal. He had made many allies in his lifetime, and he implored them to stand with Icathia.</p><p>Each time, the answer was the same. They would not defy Shurima. If Zilean\u2019s people wanted to, they would do so alone.</p><p>Returning home, he was shocked to find the council had decided to crown a new Mage King. Breathlessly, joyously, they told Zilean of the ancient and forbidden power they had discovered\u2014a power so great, it would all but guarantee Icathia\u2019s victory. </p><p>They told Zilean of the power of the Void.</p><p>He looked to these reasoned, wise Icathians, but saw only madness in their eyes. As much as it grieved him, Zilean would rather his homeland\u2019s revolution be crushed, than to let this abomination be set loose.</p><p>Zilean\u2019s worst fears proved true. Once unleashed in battle, the Void overwhelmed the mages attempting to control it, and Icathia was doomed.</p><p>As he tried to escape the capital, the ground shook. Buildings toppled. Such horrors as had no place in this world or the next erupted from the depths, driving terrified citizens before them.</p><p>They were trapped. Hundreds of thousands of innocents would die. In desperation, Zilean urged as many as he could to take refuge in his tower, and did the impossible.</p><p>He removed the entire structure from time.</p><p>Crashing to the cold floor, his power spent, Zilean looked at the frozen figures all around him. The Void was halted, but only within those walls\u2014outside, where Icathia once stood, there was nothing.</p><p>Zilean had spent decades trying to comprehend the mysteries of time and causality, and it seemed only he could move freely back and forth within the anomaly he had somehow created. These people had been saved, true enough. He just didn\u2019t know how to undo what he had done to achieve it. Through deep meditations and esoteric devices of his own design, he began to divine the strands of past and present that led to this moment, gradually learning how to move back and forth along them, looking for a future where his efforts had already succeeded\u2026</p><p>It was there that he found the true threat: the end of <i>everything</i>. The great unmaking that awaits Runeterra.</p><p>Effectively, Zilean now exists everywhere, and always has. Even so, he is only too aware of the consequences of trying to bring about change in the world and sparking other unexpected destinies\u2014often conflicting, and almost always more dangerous. Perhaps if he can find a way to save his own people, then the greater disaster might also be averted.</p><p>The only question is, what might he be willing to sacrifice along the way?</p>",

                "lore_full": "<p>As befits her Targonian Aspect\u2019s nature, Zoe did not come to the attention of the celestial realm in any traditional way. She didn\u2019t win a great victory against overwhelming odds, or sacrifice herself for a noble ideal, or overcome the existential trial of climbing Mount Targon. Instead, Zoe was a normal girl, seemingly chosen at random from among the Rakkor.</p><p>Her teachers reported Zoe to be an imaginative child, but willful, lazy, mischievous, and easily distracted. One day, as she skipped away from her studies of the holy texts to pursue something \u201cless boring,\u201d she was noticed by the Aspect of Twilight.</p><p>It observed as the young girl playfully mocked the angry cries of the scholarly priests chasing her through the village. Then, after an hour-long pursuit, she found herself cornered against the sheer drop of a cliff\u2019s edge. Before Zoe\u2019s teachers could grab her, the Aspect summoned six objects in front of her: a bag of gold coins, a sword, a completed study book, a devotion rug, a silk rope, and a toy ball. Five of these items could have let her flee, or otherwise defuse the situation.</p><p>Zoe chose the sixth option.</p><p>Unconcerned with escape or forgiveness, she instead grabbed the toy ball, kicked it toward the wall of a nearby house, and sang gleefully as it ricocheted among the humorless priests.</p><p>The Aspect hadn\u2019t seen such joyful irreverence in the face of peril since its last host, who heralded the end of the Great Darkin War. Delighted by Zoe\u2019s carefree exuberance, it opened a shimmering portal to the apex of Mount Targon, offering the girl a chance to see the universe. She dived backward into the portal, instantly merging with the Aspect, then stuck her tongue out at her dumbfounded teachers as she disappeared.</p><p>This transcendence was unique\u2014in fact, it was <i>unheard of</i> in all the myths and legends of Targon. Yet Zoe did not trouble herself with why the rules that govern Aspects had been changed just for her. She didn\u2019t trouble herself with rules at all. Instead, she journeyed to dimensions of reality at the very edge of mortal comprehension, playing with powers seen by few before or since.</p><p>While for Zoe barely a year had passed, she returned home after what had apparently been many centuries in Runeterra. Full of teenage curiosity, she wondered what she had missed while she was away. Fortunately, she could traverse the streams of time with only a thought. Among the events she witnessed were the rise and fall of \u201cthe big armored meanie,\u201d Mordekaiser; the destruction of the Blessed Isles in the \u201cSpooky Ghost Party\u201d; the cataclysms of the \u201cWar for Sparkly Rocks\u201d; and the founding of a dour new nation near the \u201cNo Fun Forest.\u201d</p><p>One thing in particular became clear to Zoe\u2014she was not alone. Walking the mortal world were other Aspects, in fact more than <i>ever</i> before. More friends for her to meet! But they brushed her aside time and again, seeming rather preoccupied with whatever it was they were doing in the spaces between realms. Intrigued, Zoe traveled to the stars, where she found the great cosmic dragon, Aurelion Sol.</p><p>Although he clearly despised her, as he did all of her kind, Zoe always returned to the dragon\u2019s side, trying to discover what aggrieved him. From his bombastic and self-aggrandizing diatribes, she gleaned that her fellow Aspects had humiliated him, crowning him with a cursed artifact to siphon away his power.</p><p>Zoe felt sorry for this poor \u201cspace doggy,\u201d and vowed to do what she could to protect him. For his part, Aurelion Sol has at least stopped threatening to destroy her when he eventually takes his long-overdue vengeance.</p><p>Whether Zoe\u2019s curious relationship with the Star Forger is due to a mere whim, possessiveness, or her function as a cosmic disrupter, no one can be certain.</p><p>For the scholars and mystics of Mount Targon, the emergence of an Aspect is usually a joyous occasion... but Zoe\u2019s unpredictability gives them pause, as not even <i>she</i> knows what her presence could portend. The only certainty is that Runeterra is on the brink of a profound transformation\u2014one that may come at the cost of chaos, destruction, and blood.</p>",
                "lore_short": "As the embodiment of mischief, imagination, and change, Zoe acts as the cosmic messenger of Targon, heralding major events that reshape worlds. Her mere presence warps the arcane mathematics governing realities, sometimes causing cataclysms without conscious effort or malice. This perhaps explains the breezy nonchalance with which Zoe approaches her duties, giving her plenty of time to focus on playing games, tricking mortals, or otherwise amusing herself. An encounter with Zoe can be joyous and life affirming, but it is always more than it appears and often extremely dangerous.",

                "lore_full": "<p>Zyra\u2019s memory is long, and runs as deep as the roots of the earth. Her kind was young when the Rune Wars raged, when mortal armies fought one another for the very keys of creation.</p><p>Hidden in the jungles south of Kumungu, somewhere between the great rivers that divide eastern Shurima, lay the fabled Gardens of Zyr. Elemental magics had turned the soil there in strange and unpredictable ways, giving rise to fierce, carnivorous plants that preyed upon any creature that strayed within reach. They infested and they devoured, caring nothing for the squabbles of mortals, content merely to coil their vines through the forests and swamplands. In their own way, they were <i>all</i> Zyra\u2026 and nourishment was plentiful, even in the midst of war.</p><p>A small company of soldiers, their allegiance long since lost to time, advanced through those lands in search of some now-forgotten prize. They were led by an ambitious sorceress\u2014but they were far from home, bound to succumb to the noxious fumes and spores of that accursed place.</p><p>The denizens of the Gardens set upon them, spined tendrils lashing through armor and flesh with sadistic ease. Though they fought valiantly, the warriors knew they could not hold out long, and turned to their sorceress to save them. Gathering her powers, she wrought a mighty blast. The air burned with runic symbols, casting their eerie light even as the thorny overgrowth closed in.</p><p>In that very instant, a rogue spark ignited the gases of the swamp, and the resulting magical explosion obliterated every living thing for miles around. Of the scattered survivors of the Rune Wars, none would ever know what fate had befallen the Gardens of Zyr.</p><p>Centuries passed. The land where the battle had been fought lay empty and lifeless above ground\u2026 but in the depths, <i>something</i> stirred. Long had the energies that were unleashed there settled, and curdled, nourished by the fallout. A seedpod bulged, pulsing with unnatural life, until a creature clawed its way free, gasping and confused.</p><p>It beheld a broken and changed world, brimming with new vitality and new ideas. Its mind was a puzzle of conflicting memories, drawn from the loamy earth and forced into its fledgling consciousness. It could recall the warmth of the sun, the taste of rain, words of power, and the agony of a hundred mortal deaths.</p><p>It\u2014<i>she</i>\u2014called herself Zyra, without quite understanding why.</p><p>As she ventured out into the wildlands beyond her birthplace, Zyra knew she was different from other creatures she encountered. Mortals were fearful and unpleasant things, while more ethereal entities tended to be capricious, or arrogant. None of them seemed to respect the realms they inhabited, despoiling everything with their mere presence, and that filled Zyra with rage and contempt. Almost unbidden, new life sprang up in her footsteps\u2014voracious plant forms that changed and evolved beneath her gaze, hurling poisonous barbs or sprouting fresh tendrils at an alarming rate.</p><p>Unrooted and free to wander, Zyra and her deadly progeny feed, and grow, strangling all other life from the world. She has blighted farmland, overrun entire settlements, and crushed those warriors brave or foolish enough to confront her, always leaving a menagerie of botanical horrors in her wake.</p><p>As the rivers of Shurima begin to run anew, strange flora has been sighted on their banks, spreading slowly westward with each passing season. Whether pulled from the earth or purged by fire, the growth does not seem to be slowing\u2026</p>",
                "lore_short": "Born in an ancient, sorcerous catastrophe, Zyra is the wrath of nature given form\u2014an alluring hybrid of plant and human, kindling new life with every step. She views the many mortals of Valoran as little more than prey for her seeded progeny, and thinks nothing of slaying them with flurries of deadly spines. Though her true purpose has not been revealed, Zyra wanders the world, indulging her most primal urges to colonize, and strangle all other life from it.",
